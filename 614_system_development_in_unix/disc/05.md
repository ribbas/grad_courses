# Question 1

Throughout the course content in this module, there have been questions and even some 'puzzles' scattered throughout. Pick one of the questions or puzzles, and give your take on the answer. Please only address a question that hasn't already been taken by one of the other students in your discussion area. Or, if you like, you can pose your own question or "puzzle" to the discussion area related to the module topics. (Making your own question or puzzle will make the required followup posts by your fellow students pretty easy.) For your question, you can also use any of the topic areas in your text which the module content didn't discuss (like "Race Conditions" in Chapter 8, or "Job Control" in Chapter 9 - oh, but don't cover setjmp/longjmp since we will cover that in the next module). Make sure your question is a bit more detailed than a simple "True/False" or one that has a simple one word answer - it has to be a question that requires at least a few sentences to answer (similar to the questions and puzzles in the Course Content).
