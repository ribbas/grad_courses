# Question 1

We are covering a pretty big language and topic in just a week. There are a lot of topics in Perl we didn't even touch on in our Course Content. For this discussion, take a look at the on-line references, and the Schwartz text if you have it, and pick one aspect of Perl we didn't touch on which is of interest to you. Explain that aspect in your discussion post, and either 'teach' the rest of your discussion group about it, perhaps even with an example you can share with the class, or describe how this topic interests you, but there is some aspect of it you don't quite understand - why something works the way it does, or why something you think should work doesn't - and let the rest of us (me included) help figure it out.

# Question 2

Alternatively, for those who have known Perl before the class, another common debate is the merits of Perl versus Python. For those who have worked with one, or both, this is a chance for you to express your opinion on which is better. We chose to spend more time covering Perl in this class and less on Python; would it have been better to focus more on Python? Be sure to give some good support for your position.
