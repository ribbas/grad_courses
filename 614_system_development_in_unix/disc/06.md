# Question 1

Take a look at the manual page (or your text) for the flags which can be put into the sa_flags field of the sigaction structure. Some of these (e.g. SA_RESETHAND) seem to be present to allow the older, more problematic behavior of signals to continue. Which of these flags are present for this purpose, and more importantly, when would you use these particular flags, and why?

# Question 2

Certain functions should not be called from within signal handling functions. What kind of functions and why?

# Question 3

Next week we will be talking about threads. In some sense, why could a signal handling function can be considered a thread within a process? Can you outline, perhaps at a high level, how you might implement threads inside a process using signals and signal handlers? (Hint: you might want to look at signal stacks.) Are there any limitations in implementing threads in this way?
