# Question 1
Only one post is required. This will be your final post for the course (so this really isn't a discussion). Since this is our last post, let me know the one topic in our weeks together throughout this semester in which you learned the most, and felt was most valuable, and why. If you like, you can also relate the topic of least interest, but you don't have to. Thanks for your input!

One concept (and I had already mentioned it during that module!) I found most beneficial to me from the course was threads! I've always had issues grasping the different methods of parallelizing processes, especially after primarily working in high level programming languages where the implementation details are abstracted away. For example, in undergrad, I had to develop a Python program that ran some concurrent computations. I had no idea which library to use - _threads, threading, or multiprocessing? What was the difference, and did it matter? I've heard of pthreads by that time - does Python's threading library use that under the hood? I was aware that Python used a Global Interpreter Lock - was this different from locks used in multithreaded processes? Over time, I learned which libraries and methods to use to achieve decent concurrent executions, but never fully grasped the theories behind them.
