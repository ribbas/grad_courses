Very insightful finds! Playing around with your script led me to learn more about the paths for message queues on different machines as well. One thing that I haven't realized before today was the location of message queues can be modified by any superuser. According to mq_overview (in the section where you were most likely referring as well) message queues are created in a specified virtual filesystem via the following commands:

```shell
su
mkdir /dev/mqueue
mount -t mqueue none /dev/mqueue
```

This shows that message queues can be mounted in any directory, which can lead to some interesting outcomes. For example, on my host machine where I have superuser privileges, I am able to mount the filesystem in my current directory: 

I can then run a modified version of your script where it also accepts a user-provided path to the message queue filesystem:
 

When I pause the execution and peak at the files on both of the directories, it turns out they form links to each other:
 

Unfortunately, this has only been tested on Linux.
