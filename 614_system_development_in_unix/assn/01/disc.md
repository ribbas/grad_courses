# Discussion

For this module, you are required to participate in the discussion area addressing the following discussion questions:

## Question 1

Do you believe that the UNIX environment is a good environment for software and system development? What in the discussion of UNIX history would pertain to software development?

## Question 2

The evolution of the UNIX operating system has taken several distinct paths (e.g., the AT&T System V path and the Berkeley Standard Distribution (BSD) path). How has this evolution along several distinct paths affected the overall acceptance of the UNIX operating system?

## Question 3

Give one reason that the distribution of the UNIX operating system to universities in source code form was a significant event in the history of UNIX.

You are required to post at least twice to this discussion to recieve full credit. One post must be original, based on one of the discussion questions above. The second post must be a response to another students (or my) post. Be sure to pay attention and adhere to the "due" dates for the discussions in the Calendar.
Since this is your first discussion assignment, let me emphasize a couple of points. Your initial post does not have to be long - no more than a paragraph will do. You don't have to address all the points listed above - pick one of them, but try not to pick one that has been addressed by many of your fellow students. (Yes, this does mean I expect you to read your fellow students' posts.) Don't feel bound by the points listed above - if you have a question or a point related to the module content which you would like to see discussed by your fellow students, then by all means post it.
