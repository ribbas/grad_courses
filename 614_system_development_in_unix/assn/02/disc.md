# Question 1

One of the confusing aspects regarding building systems based on compiled languages is the relationship between libraries and include files. In this discussion, I would like you to examine this relationship. Why doesn't it make sense to ask about compiling and library files? Or linking and include files? Are include files and library files related? In what way?

# Question 2

The make facility is arguably the initial build capability present for software systems. Many other build systems (e.g. ant, waf, etc.) have evolved since 'make' was introduced. If you are familiar with one of these other build systems (or, you can look into one of them), compare and contrast their capability with 'make'. A list of build systems can be found here: [List of build systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_build_automation_software)

From the list of build systems provided, I have used SCons and sbt before and have had significantly different experiences with them.
