# Homework Project #3

# System Development in the Unix Environment (605.614)

Hierarchy, Makefiles, and Script (out of 15): 13

-Hierarchy, and Script are correct.

-(-1) depend_list is not included in the Makefile, so dependencies are lost

-(-1) Make “it” should not have a dependency on “depend”

Correctness of Programs (out of 25): 25

-Program tests run correctly.

Correctness of Library (out of 60): 50

-(-1) Follow the style guide for global variable naming. They should begin with a capital letter.

-(-1) Your file descriptor (fd) needs to be initialized to a non-valid value (ex. -1).

-(-1) Use perror/errno to print specific error returns from system calls.

-Thanks for the README

-(-1) log_event should call set_logfile to reduce duplication of code

-(-1) set_logfile needs to close the file descriptor before overwriting with open

-(-5) log_event calls open on each call to log_event. This will result in using a new file descriptor on each call without closing the previous. Open should only be called in the case there is not a currently open file or via set_logfile. By putting some debug in your code to print the file descriptor value, you will see that it eventually runs out of available ones for the process and if you use perror to print errors on open, it will tell you that it exceeded the number of available file descriptors. I was able to duplicate this problem by using lots_of_logs and increasing the number of log messages printed.
