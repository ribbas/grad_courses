# Compiler Project C- Semantic Analysis

The ANTLR4 tool was installed and ran using the instructions in the official documentations, https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/blob/master/doc/getting-started.md.

The tool and its dependencies were installed on the system using `apt`. The following commands were used to generate the java and class files:

```
antlr4 Cminus.g4
javac Cminus*.java
```

The generated files are moved to `generated` and the object files in `objects`.

The provided Makefile compiles the main C++ script and links with the runtime library. The symbol table is implemented in the `Symtab.hpp` classes. The semantic predicates are defined in the `SemPred.hpp` classes.

## System

The target machine used was an Ubuntu 20.04 64-bit virtual machine. The Linux kernel version is 5.13.0-28-generic. The following output is generated from running the command `uname -orm`:

```
5.13.0-28-generic x86_64 GNU/Linux
```
