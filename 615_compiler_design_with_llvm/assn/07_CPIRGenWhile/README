# Week 10: Compiler Project Global/While IR Gen

The ANTLR4 tool was installed and ran using the instructions in the official documentations, https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/blob/master/doc/getting-started.md.

The tool and its dependencies were installed on the system using `apt`.

The generated files, including the visitor and listener files, are moved to `generated` and the object files in `objects`.

## Modifications made for the assignment

## Output files

1. `C-Output-0.sym`, `C-Output-1.sym`, and `C-Output-3.sym` contains the symbol table generated by `C-Input-0.txt`, `C-Input-0.txt`, and `C-Input-3.txt` respectively.
2. `C-Output-0.ll`, `C-Output-1.ll`, and `C-Output-3.ll` contains the IR generated by `C-Input-0.txt`, `C-Input-0.txt`, and `C-Input-3.txt` respectively.

## System

The attached CMakeLists.txt was used to compile the assignment files. The following are the version numbers of the tools used:

| Tool    | Version |
| ------- | ------- |
| Clang++ | 14.0.0  |
| CMake   | 3.22.2  |

The target machine used was an Ubuntu 20.04 64-bit virtual machine. The Linux kernel version is 5.13.0-39-generic. The following output is generated from running the command `uname -orm`:
