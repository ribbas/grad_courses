# Week 12: Compiler Project Target Code Generation

The ANTLR4 tool was installed and ran using the instructions in the official documentations, https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/blob/master/doc/getting-started.md.

The tool and its dependencies were installed on the system using `apt`.

```
llc -filetype=obj C-IO.ll -o io.o
clang io.o C-Input.o -o C-Input-0
```
