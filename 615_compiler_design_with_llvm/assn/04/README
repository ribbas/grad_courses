# Week 4: Spreadsheet Recursive Descent Parser

## Modifications for assignment

The provided Skeleton-Spreadsheet-v2 was used as the outline for this assignment. Only the following files were modified to implement the program:

1. `HW2-Driver.cpp` was removed due to its lack of necessity for the assignment.
2. `SS-Driver.cpp` was re-linted to remove unnecessary comments
3. `Scanner.h` and `Scanner.cpp` had attributes and methods added. Most of the additions were carried over from the Week 2 Assignment. Some attributes, such as `const char HW2_Index`, were removed after refactoring the methods that check for symbols. The `Token* getToken(char*& ch)` method was moved to `Parser` but implemented in this class. The method was modified to support additional symbols.
4. `Parser.h` and `Parser.cpp` had all of its skeleton methods implemented. The attributes `Token* lookahead` and `bool invalidToken` were added to the class. `lookahead` is the current token that gets recursively parsed. `invalidToken` is set to true if an invalid token is found in the equation.
5. `SS_Cell.cpp` had minor re-linted

## Unresolved issues
