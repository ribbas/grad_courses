# Optimization Research

## Week 8

- Select two of the LLVM Optimizations from the list in class.
- Produce Readable IR files (.ll) that demonstrate the before and after state of the IR for each of your selected optimizations. (I recommend using the Opt executable for this.) If printed diagrams are available that help demonstrate an optimization they should also be included.
- Submit a zip file containing a readme file and the readable IR before and after files and any diagrams. Be sure to identify which files go with which optimization.

## Week 9

- Produce a short research paper for each selected optimization. Your paper will be shared with everyone in the class. So make it presentable.
- You must include:
  - The title of the optimization
  - The full description of the title of the optimization
  - The optimizationâ€™s pass category
  - An explanation of the optimization
  - Your before and after code demonstrating the optimization
  - Any diagrams that demonstrate the optimization
  - A list of any Analysis Passes that must be run and available before the pass
  - A list of the Analysis Passes that are invalidated
  - A list of the Analysis Passes that are preserved
  - A list of the references that you used
- Submit a final draft of your paper as a .doc (not .docx) or a PDF to Blackboard before the Week 9 class.

## Week 10

- You should incorporate my comments and prepare a final paper to distribute to myself and your classmates (preferably a day or two) before the Week 10 class.
- Prepare a PowerPoint presentation for each optimization selected to be given in the Week 10 class. Each presentation should be 15 to 20 minutes and should include the points described for the paper especially the information about the Analysis Passes. Expect to have a little Q&A time.
