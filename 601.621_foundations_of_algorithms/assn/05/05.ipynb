    "\n",
    "Using induction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $x$ be a node from the tree, and $n$ be the depth of the tree. We know that there exists at most $2^n$ nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The base step:  If $x$ is a leaf node, (or a single node, with $n=1$), then `postorder(x)` will only be called once since there exists no node `x` with `x.left == root` or `x.right == root`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inductive step: If $x$ is a node with 1 or 2 child nodes, with $n=k$, then `postorder(x)` will only be called at most twice for both the left and right child nodes. Since no nodes are called more than twice, the worst case complexity is $O(2k)$ with the best case complexity is $O(k)$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Suppose you are acting as a consultant for the Port Authority of a small Pacific Rim nation. They are currently doing a multi-billion-dollar business per year, and their revenue is constrained almost entirely by the rate at which they can unload ships that arrive in the port.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a basic sort of problem they face. A ship arrives with $n$ containers of weight $w_1, w_2, ..., w_n$. Standing on the deck is a set of trucks, each of which can hold $K$ units of weight. (You may assume that $K$ and $w_i$ are integers.) You can stack multiple containers in each truck, subject to the weight restrictions of $K$. The goal is to minimize the number of trucks that are needed to carry all the containers. This problem is NP-complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "A greedy algorithm you might use for this is the following. Start with an empty truck and begin piling containers 1, 2, 3, ... onto it until you get to a container that would overflow the weight limit. (These containers might not be sorted by weight.) Now declare this truck \"loaded\" and send it off. Then continue the process with a fresh truck. By considering trucks one at a time, this algorithm may not achieve the most efficient way to pack the full set of containers into an available collection of trucks."

In all of the $m$ groups, 2 trucks are needed to carry the weights that total greater than $K$. Therefore, the greedy algorithm uses at least $m$ trucks, since $W>mk$ or $W/K > m$, and is withing a factor of 2 of $k=2m$."
