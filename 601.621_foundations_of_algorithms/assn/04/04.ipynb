    "\\[20 pts, AVL trees\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall an AVL binary search tree is a BST where, for each node in the tree, the height of its children differs by no more than 1. For this problem, assume we have a team of biologists that keep information about DNA sequences in an AVL binary search tree using the specific weight (an integer) of the structure as the key. The biologists routinely ask questions of the type, \"Are there any structures in the tree with specific weight between $a$ and $b$, inclusive?\" and they hope to get an answer as soon as possible. Design an efficient algorithm that, given integers $a$ and $b$, returns True if there exists a key $x$ in the tree such that $a ≤ x ≤ b$, and False if no such key exists in the tree. Describe your algorithm in English and pseudocode. What is the time complexity of your algorithm? Explain."

    "Searching in an AVL tree is a similar operation to searching a regular binary search tree (BST). However, searching in BST results in a worst-case $O(n)$ time complexity whilst searching in an AVL tree results in a worst-case $O(lg n)$ time complexity due to its self-balancing property imposed by its height restrictions.\n",

    "To search for a key of value $x$ given $a$ and $b$ such that $a ≤ x ≤ b$, we can devise a recursive solution. For the boundary conditions, $x = a$, $x = b$ or $a = b$, the search ends and returns True immediately. Otherwise, the algorithm would search the left subtree if $a < x$ or the left subtree if $x > b$. If the search algorithm traverses all the way down to a leaf node, then the constraint fails and False is returned.\n",
