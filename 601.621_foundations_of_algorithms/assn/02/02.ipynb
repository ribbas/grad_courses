    "An example of a divide-and-conquer solution to an everyday problem is gathering items at the grocery store. If I head to the store by myself, I would have to find and gather the items in my grocery list by traversing through each of the aisles that hold the wanted items. If I brought another person with me to help me, we can divide up portions of the grocery list so that we each have to traverse through the aisles on our sides of the store; i.e. I gather items from the produce section while the other person gathers items at the poultry section. The more people I bring with me, the faster all the items can be found and gathered. After all the items are gathered, they can be all be checked out."

A good chip always reports accurately whether the other chip is good or bad, but the professor cannot trust the answer of a bad chip. Thus, the four possible outcomes of a test are as follows:\n",

Furthermore, the bad chips can conspire to report each other as good chips and confuse the professor even more."
