    "You are given $K$ number of coins with equal weights and a mechanical balance scale that can show if the pans (and their loads) are balanced or not. The problem is posed as finding the single different coin in the collection, which was mixed up accidentally. Devise the quickest algorithm, which can find the different coin. Generalize your solution for any $K$. Show the recurrence relation, time and space complexity."

    "To find the different coin, we begin by first finding the expected weight of the coins, $w$. This can be achieved by measuring the weights of 2 coins from the collection of $K$ coins. If the coins do not weight the same, then one of the coins is the different one. We can figure out which of the coins is the one we are looking for by comparing both of them with another coin from the collection of $K$ coins.\n",
    "\n",
    "If both of the coins weigh the same, then we store that value $w$ for further computation. We can assume that any coins that do not weigh $w$ is the one we are looking for. We begin by splitting the collection of $K$ coins to two subcollections of $K/2$ coins. Then, we measure each of the entire collections of $K/2$ coins separately and then divide the weight by $K/2$. If the average of the weights of the subcollections is $w$, then we push away that subcollection and focus on the other one. We can recursively divide and measure the weights of the subcollections until we have found the different coin.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process can be generalized to $j$ divisions of the collections instead of 2. This will lead to dividing the collection of $K$ coins to $j$ collections of $K/j$ coins."

    "\n",
    "In the setup stage, if the different coin is one of the first 2 coins, then the algorithm ends after 1 more comparison. This branch would weigh 3 coins and make at most 3 comparisons with a recurrence relation of $6\\cdot O(1)$ or $O(1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the setup stage, if the different coin is NOT one of the first 2 coins, then we proceed with the recursive divide and conquer method. Dividing and weighing $j$ piles of the total $K$ coins would take at most $O(log_j(K))$ iterations (dividing by $j$ more piles every iterations). Therefore, the recurrence relation for the time complexity would become $T(n)=O(log_j(K))$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As per its space complexity, the algorithm would only need to allocate additional memory for the initialization variables, such as $w$. The original collection of $K$ coins can be the largest container of these coins - after each iteration when the collection is divided into $j$ piles, the original container can be used as lesser space is required after each iterations. Therefore, the space complexity can be $O(K)$."
