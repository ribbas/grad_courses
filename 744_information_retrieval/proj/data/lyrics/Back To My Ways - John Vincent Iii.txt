With every step I take
I'm taking one step away from you
And when I close my eyes
I hear the wind in the northern plains

Oh and I've been wasting away this time
Allowing doubt to fill my mind
Oh and I've been spending all that I have
On cheap tattoos

Oh, but maybe one day
When I'm out there on the road
I'll think of you
Oh, maybe one day
I'll be there with you

Well that's the end of it [?]
Myself [?]
These dreams don't seem to do the same as they used to now
Oh honey, when I ask myself what the hell am I doing here
What am I doing here?
Thought of you
And all the nights we shared under the sky
When you were lonely

Oh, but maybe one day
When I'm out there on the road
I'll think of you
Oh, maybe one day
I'll be there with you
