Change, like the wind, like the water, like skin
Change, like the sky, like the leaves, like a butterfly

Would you live forever and never die
While everything around passes?
Would you smile forever and never cry
While everything you know passes?

Death, like a door to a place we've never been before
Death, like space, the deep sea, a suitcase

Would you stare forever at the sun
Never watch the moon rising?
Would you walk forever in the light
To never learn the secret of the quiet night?

Still, like a stone, like a hill, like home
Still, what I find, is you were always on my mind

Could I feel happy for you
When I hear you talk with her like we used to?
Could I set everything free
When I watch you holding her the way you once held me?

Change, like the sky, like the leaves, like a butterfly
Death, like a door to a place we've never been before

Would you live forever and never die
While everything around passes?
Would you smile forever and never cry?
