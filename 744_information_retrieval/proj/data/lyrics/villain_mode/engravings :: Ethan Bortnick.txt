Eyes, blood, bones
Stuck in your rainbow clothes
Rest my case
If it's not rearranged

Trading panic attacks, you finally threw it all back
Then you told me how he abused you
You had to gut out the truth
But I already knew that you've got nothing left to lose

Strip for me
Took off everything except your sleeves
All the pain is underneath, I'm listenin'
To everything, please, tell me everything
I'll put my hand upon your chest
So you forget your engravings

Not one bite
Stomach knots from our fight
Can't do shit
The puzzle pieces don't fit

You warned me of other guys and then you told me you lied
You schemed to see my reaction
I had to throw up the truth
But you already knew that in a month we'd be strangers

Strip for me
Took off everything except your sleeves
All the pain is underneath, I'm listenin'
To everything, please, tell me everything
I'll put my hand upon your chest
So you forget your engravings
