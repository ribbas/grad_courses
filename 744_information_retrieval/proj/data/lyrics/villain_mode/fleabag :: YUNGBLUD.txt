I'm just a fleabag
Nobody loves me
Send me to rehab
Somebody touch me
I wanna turn back time
I wanna fix the way I was designed
Crawl behind my eyes
And kill my stale state of mind

I fade and fade, and every time
I try to change, to change
I stop

'Cause I'm just a fleabag
Nobody loves me
Send me to rehab
Somebody touch me
I'm not your monkey
I'm not your puppet
I'm just a fleabag
Nobody loves me at all
Hey, hey
Nobody loves me
Hey, hey
Nobody loves me

I dance around the truth
I'll be a ballerina boy for you
No matter what I do
You twist my words and get confused

So I fade and I fade
And every time
I try to change, to change
I stop

'Cause I'm just a fleabag
Nobody loves me
Send me to rehab
Somebody touch me
I'm not your monkey
I'm not your puppet
I'm just a fleabag
Nobody loves me at all
Hey, hey
Nobody loves me
Hey, hey
Nobody loves me

I'm just a fleabag
Nobody loves me
Send me to rehab
Somebody touch me
I'm not your monkey
I'm not your puppet
I'm just a fleabag
Nobody loves me at all
Hey, hey
Nobody loves me
Hey, hey
Nobody loves me at all
