(I'm so tired of California, I'm so tired of L.A
Where the real thing comes as often, as the California rain)

I get sick of sunshine, on my perfect skin
Vapid conversation, giving me head-spins
Driving down Mulholland, closing both my eyes
'Cause they say you get more famous when you die

And everyone seems fine
Am I losing my mind?

I'm so tired of California, I'm so tired of L.A
Where the real thing comes as often, as the California rain
I got all these legal toxins in my blood and in my brain
I keep saying that I'm leaving but it doesn't work that way

(Mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm-mm)

I can't feel my heartbeat, way up in the hills
Burning down my mansion, didn't write a will
Front row at my funeral, crocodile tears
Came here for the weekend, but I haven't left in years
(Is that weird?)

I'm so tired of California, I'm so tired of L.A
Where the real thing comes as often, as the California rain
I got all these legal toxins in my blood and in my brain
I keep saying that I'm leaving but it doesn't work that way

(Mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm-mm)

Can I be young forever?
Would it be fun, forever?
Can I be young forever?
Would it be fun, forever?

(We're so tired of California, we're so tired of L.A
Where the real thing comes as often, as the California rain
We got all these legal toxins in our blood and in our brains
We keep saying that we're leaving but it doesn't work that way)

I'm so tired of California, I'm so tired of L.A
Where the real thing comes as often, as the California rain
I got all these legal toxins in my blood and in my brain
I keep saying that I'm leaving but it doesn't work that way
