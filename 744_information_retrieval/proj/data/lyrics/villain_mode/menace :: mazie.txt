I'm a menace
Everything I want, yeah, you I know I'm gonna get it
Whether it's your fame or your cable knit sweater
You might've done it first, but I know I do it better
Yeah, I said it

I'm a menace, don't forget it
I'm a menace, don't forget it
I'm a menace, don't forget it
I'm a menace, don't forget it

I'm not the guy to look up to (Okay)
I'm cuttin' lines just to cut loose (Woo, woo, woo)
Now I'm seeing God in the bathroom
She thinks I'm cool, but she gave me some bad news
I'm gonna change the world in the worst way
Greta Thunberg in a Hummer on a highway
Ooh, bummer that she'll never see it my way (Never)
You and I are not the same

I'm a menace
Everything I want, yeah, you I know I'm gonna get it
Whether it's your fame or your cable knit sweater
You might've done it first, but I know I do it better
Yeah, I said it

I'm a menace, don't forget it
I'm a menace, don't forget it
I'm a menace, don't forget it
I'm a menace, don't forget it

I eat billionaires for breakfast
Diamonds on my necklace
I only go to parties 'cause they love to watch me exit (I'm a, a, a)
Mattress ambidextrous
Sex tape on your Netflix (Woo)
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a

I'm a menace, don't forget it (Oh, hey)
I'm a menace, don't forget it (I'm a)
I'm a menace
