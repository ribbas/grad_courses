I got in a fight, I was indisposed
I was in despite all the wicked prose
But I'm only a man
And I do what I can

I got friends in high places, I get out for free
I got in a fight but they don't know me
'Cause I'm only a man
And I do what I can

B-E-H-A-V-E
Arrest us
Italiana mobster looking so precious
B-E-H-A-V-E

You gave up being good when you declared a state of war

I don't behave, I don't behave, oh eh
I don't behave, I don't behave, oh eh
I don't behave, I don't behave, oh
Are you going to the party? Are you going to the show?
'Cause I'm only a man,
Do what I can,
Ooh-whoa-oh
'Cause I'm only a man,
Do what I can
Are you going to the party? Are you going to the show?

I did something bad, maybe I was wrong
Sometimes people say that I'm a big time bomb
But I'm only a man
And I do what I can

B-E-H-A-V-E

Oh, the fire it's alright
'Cause we can make 'em all go crazy
We can make 'em wanna die
Oh, the fire it's alright
The people touch it
I can't touch it, even though it's mine

I don't behave, I don't behave, oh eh
I don't behave, I don't behave, oh eh
I don't behave, I don't behave, oh
