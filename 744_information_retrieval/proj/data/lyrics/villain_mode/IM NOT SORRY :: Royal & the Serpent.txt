Hey
It's a beautiful day
To be an asshole
To be an asshole
I got something to say
Get the fuck out my way
Don't know if I'll make it till tomorrow
Without losing all my marbles

I wanna kill everybody
I'm not sorry, I'm not sorry
I'm better than everybody
I'm not sorry, I'm not sorry

Hey
I'm fucking insane
I should be on medication
But my doctor's on vacation
I'm digging your grave
With a smile on my face
I seem alright on the surface
But when you look behind the curtains, I

I wanna kill everybody
I'm not sorry, I'm not sorry
I'm better than everybody
I'm not sorry, I'm not sorry

Hey
It's a beautiful day
To be an asshole
And I don't give a flying fuck
It's a beautiful day
To be an asshole
To be an asshole
And I don't give a flying fuck

I wanna kill everybody
I'm not sorry, I'm not sorry
