There are moments in the day
When I just lose myself in sorrow and forget

How the sky has been much bluer
And my life just so much sweeter since we met

You make my day, with what you say
A world of calm, inside your arms, I hope you know

The love you bring, the song you sing, I overflow
I hope you know, I hope you know

My current mood
Is gratitude
My current mood
Is gratitude
