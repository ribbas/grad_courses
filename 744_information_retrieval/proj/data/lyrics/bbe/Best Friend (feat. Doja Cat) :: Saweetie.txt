That my best friend, she a real bad bitch
Got her own money, she don't need no nig'
On the dance floor, she had two, three drinks
Now she twerkin', she throw it out and come back in
That's my best friend, she a real bad bitch
Drive her own car, she don't need no Lyft
In the strip club, know my girl gon' tip
Now she twerkin', she throw it out and come back in

Beep beep, is that my bestie in a Tessie?
Fresh blow out, skin on 10 owe she ready
Bitch, you look goodt, with a T at the end
I'ma hype her every time, that my motherfuckin' friend
She been down since the jellies and the bo bo's
Now we steppin out the G in manolo's
When we pull up to scene hoes be filled with jealousy
If a bitch get finicky, she gon' bring that energy (Pop-pop-pop)
I hit her phone with the tea, like, "Bitch, guess what?"
All the rich ass boys wanna fuck on us
All this ass sittin' up, you can look, don't touch
And I'm bad bussin bands every time we link up

That my best friend, she a real bad bitch
Got her own money, she don't need no nig'
On the dance floor, she had two, three drinks
Now she twerkin', she throw it out and come back in
That's my best friend, she a real bad bitch
Drive her own car, she don't need no Lyft
In the strip club, know my girl gon' tip
Now she twerkin', she throw it out and come back in

That my best friend, if you need a freak
I ain't dumb, but motherfucker, she my Tweedle D
If she ride for me (Ride), she don't need a key
If you side ways, she'll straighten you as needed be
And she so bad that I just can't take that bitch nowhere
She off her fish, I said, "Mm-mm, don't go there"
Bitch, break her back, she protect and attack
Get that strap let them buckle, foot on neck, give no air
Whole world wanna be us
And my main bitch, she my day-one
On my way, bitch, let you get drunk
Let's celebrate 'cause we the baddest in the club

That my best friend, she a real bad bitch
Got her own money, she don't need no nig'
On the dance floor, she had two, three drinks
Now she twerkin', she throw it out and come back in
That's my best friend, she a real bad bitch
Drive her own car, she don't need no Lyft
In the strip club, know my girl gon' tip
Now she twerkin', she throw it out and come back in

Hah, best friend, you the baddest and you know it (You know)
Uh-oh, girl I think our booty growin' (Ay yeah)

Best friend damn your wrist look like it's frozen

Best friend, you my motherfuckin' soulmate (Soulmate)
