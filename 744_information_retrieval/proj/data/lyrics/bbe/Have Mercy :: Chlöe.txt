(Murda on the beat, so it's not nice)
Booty so big (Work), Lord, have mercy

Why I keep bossing like I do (Work, work it, work it)
Why I keep flossing like I do (Work, work it, work it)
Why I keep saucing like I do (Work, work it, work it)
Why it keep costing like it do (Work, work it, work it)
All this ass up in my jeans (Work, work it, work it)
You can't get up in between (Work, work it, work it)
You tryna get a piece of me (Work, work it, work it)
I can teach you a couple things (Lord, have mercy, work)

Boy, you lookin' at me like I ain't give you no choice
If I count to three, bet you be on your knees
You wrapped 'round my hand like Cartier, oh
You can't get this thickness out of your mind

He say he like that Laffy Taffy
He so goofy, call me daddy
He go stupid, he go daffy
Introduce me to his papi
He can never live without me
I'm so real, I'm never cappin'
If he got it like that, like that
I can take it, take it there
'Cause my
Booty so big (Work), Lord, have mercy

Why I keep bossing like I do (Boss)
Why I keep flossing like I do (Floss)
Why I keep saucing like I do (Sauce)
Why it keep costing like it do (Cost)
All this ass up in my jeans
You can't get up in between
You tryna get a piece of me
I can teach you a couple things (Lord, have mercy)
Why I keep bossing like I do (Boss)
Why I keep flossing like I do (Floss)
Why I keep saucing like I do (Sauce)
Why it keep costing like it do (Cost)
All this ass up in my jeans
You can't get up in between
You tryna get a piece of me
I can teach you a couple things

How to surf it, man, how to work it, man
It's on purpose, I'm doin' it big
Body language like speaking Spanglish

Temporary, that's never rare-y
I'm necessary, yeah, I am that bitch
You can't get this thickness out of your mind
