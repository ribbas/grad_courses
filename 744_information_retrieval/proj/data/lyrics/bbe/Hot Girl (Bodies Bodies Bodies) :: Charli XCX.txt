Rodeo drive is where I like to shop, I like it really bad in my Bentley top (Vroom vroom)
'Cause when I pull up and step out I shine (Yeah), I'm a Tony, I'm cutting the line (I'm Tony)
Yeah, I'm buttery, creamy and vine, my acrylics are on, my white wine (Bling)
I travel 'round the globe, Paris Fashion Week and I'm in the front row (Bonjour)
I'm going skiing even when the slopes are closed
'Cause I'm so hot with snow up my nose
