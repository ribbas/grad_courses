Could've said this day was coming
I say your name like I might phone
You're half in revelations
Wish you'd never let me go
And you say that you miss me (I'm sure that you miss me)
Funny how you think you're such a mystery
Say you gotta tell me something face to face

I know I shouldn't do it, but, hell, I'm gonna do it
I see exactly where I shouldn't go, I'm gonna do it
I've been trying out the high road and then I hit it
I got a lotta sins, but you're my favorite

Baby, you're a bad idea but I could do a few more years
I got a little left in here, funny how you reappear
In the nick of time, I guess I didn't bite
Can't say we didn't try, baby, we're a bad idea
Fuck it, let's do it again

You'll pick somewhere that's private
You and I can really speak
Go ahead and tell me something
That you learned in therapy
And it's almost convincing (It's almost convincing)
But I've known to go against my instincts
And I know you're performing
But it's working for me
We can talk about it in the morning

Baby, you're a bad idea but I could do a few more years
I got a little left in here, funny how you reappear
In the nick of time, I guess I didn't bite
Can't say we didn't try, baby, we're a bad idea
Fuck it, let's do it again

Bottom line, you made it out the first time
Still in love and half alive
We didn't die but no currencies this time
We might
Alright, fuck it, let's do it again

Baby, you're a bad idea but I could do a few more years
I got a little left in here, funny how you reappear
In the nick of time, I guess I didn't bite
Can't say we didn't try, baby, we're a bad idea
Fuck it, let's do it again
