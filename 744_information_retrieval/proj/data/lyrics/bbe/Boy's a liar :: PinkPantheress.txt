Take a look inside your heart
Is there any room for me?
I would have to hold my breath
'Til you get down on one knee
Because you only want to hold me
When I'm looking good enough
Did you ever fault me?
Would you ever picture us?
Every time I pull my hair out
Was only out of fear
That'd you find me ugly
And one day we'll disappear

Because what's the point of crying?
It was never even love
Did you ever want me?
Was I ever good enough?

The- The boy's a liar (The boy's a liar)
The boy's a player (The boy's a player)
He doesn't see ya (He doesn't see ya)
You're not looking at me, boy (You're not looking at me, boy)
The boy's a liar (The boy's a liar)
The boy's a player (The boy's a player)
He doesn't see ya (He doesn't see ya)
You're not looking at me, boy (You're not looking at me, boy)

Good enough, ough, ough
Good enough, ough, ough
Good enough, ough, ough
Good enough, ough, ough
Good enough, ough, ough
Good enough, ough, ough
Good enough, ough, ough
Good enough, ough, ough

Baby, please
I just want to light things for you
Come stay with me, oh
You're not around to watch what I do
I thought you'd like those
Look about as gorgeous like me
Baby, please
I know you want to change me

Can you take a look inside your heart
Is there any room for me?
I would have to hold my breath
'Til you get down on one knee
Because what's the point of crying?
It was never even love
Did you ever want me?
Was I ever good enough?

The- The boy's a liar (The boy's a liar)
The boy's a player (The boy's a player)
He doesn't see ya (He doesn't see ya)
You're not looking at me, boy (You're not looking at me, boy)
The boy's a liar (The boy's a liar)
The boy's a player (The boy's a player)
He doesn't see ya (He doesn't see ya)
You're not looking at me, boy (You're not looking at me, boy)

Good enough, ough, ough
Good enough, ough, ough
Good enough, ough, ough
Good enough, ough, ough
Good enough, ough, ough
Good enough, ough, ough
Good enough, ough, ough
Good enough, ough, ough
