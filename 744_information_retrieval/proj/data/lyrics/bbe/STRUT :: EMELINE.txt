I like turning heads, breaking necks
High heels in the morning
Catch your breath, break a sweat
Leave the suckers snoring

These saints are watching me
My sex life like TMZ
You're welcome, bitch, the show is free

I don't do the walk of shame, I strut (Strut)
You can suck my dust (Dust)
Blow a kiss goodbye
I got mine, love

I don't do the walk of shame, I strut (Strut)
I just came to fuck (Fuck)
Blow a kiss goodbye
I got mine, love

I don't do the walk of shame, I
Strut

They say I'm tragically obsessed
Hot mess
God forbid I'm
Getting what I like
Every night
Make 'em livid

All these saints are watching me
My sex life like TMZ
You're welcome, bitch, the show is free

I don't do the walk of shame, I strut (Strut)
You can suck my dust (Dust)
Blow a kiss goodbye
I got mine, love

I don't do the walk of shame, I strut (Strut)
I just came to fuck (Fuck)
Blow a kiss goodbye
I got mine, love

I don't do the walk of shame, I
Strut

I don't do the walk of shame, I
Strut

I don't do the walk of shame, I
Strut
