A lucky, lucky girl
She got married to a boy like you
She'd kick you out if she ever, ever knew
'Bout all the ... you tell me that you do
Dirty, dirty boy
You know everyone is talkin' on the scene
I hear them whisperin' 'bout the places that you've been
And how you don't know how to keep your business clean

Mummy don't know daddy's getting hot
At the body shop
Doin' somethin' unholy

And when you want it, baby, I know I got you covered
And when you need it, baby, just jump under the covers (Yeah)
