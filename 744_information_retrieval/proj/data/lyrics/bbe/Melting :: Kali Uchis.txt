You are my church, you are my place of worship
I heard you're the plug, can I be the circuit?
When I got court, I hope that you're the verdict
When you're around, my insides turn inverted
My blood start to rush when I see you, darling
I know you're nearby and I know your purpose
Take one look at you, you're heavens incarnate
What is this spell baby, please show some mercy

[Chorus:]
Melting like an ice cream
When you smile
Melting, you're a daydream
Stay a while

I pray that I can learn to be funny
I am watching every stand-up comedy
Just hoping that it will rub off on me
So you will smile at everything I say
You got some soft lips and some pearly whites
I wanna touch them with the dead of night
Your smile ignites just like a candlelight
Then somehow I know everything's alright

[Chorus x2]
