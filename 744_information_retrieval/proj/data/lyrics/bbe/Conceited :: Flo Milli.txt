Flo Milli shit!

You never dated a chocolate bitch
You want a model bitch out for the internet
All that ke ke ke
I ain't in to that
All my mini- me's
I invented that, facts
Long ass weave, flow down my back
I want a picture with a baseball bat
Hoes don't like when I talk like that
Please, don't bark, cause Milli bite back
I huff and puff and I blow shit down
Stand up bitch, hoe go sit down
Put your ear on this coochie
Hear this whole shit sound
I fucked once
Boy you old dick now
You got money, cause you on dicks
Milli got Millis cause Milli got hits
You pop pimples, hoe I pop shit
You can talk like this when you're really that bitch

Straight outta Mobile
Louis on both heels
Fuck how a hoe feel
Girl just relax
Smack a little bitch
Hoe you a gnat
Bitch get jealous when I do it like that
Celine on my eyes like a diva
I've been that bitch since a fetus
Been had my stripes, no Adidas
My ops taking pics when they see us
I'm so fabulous
Bitch I'm fabulous
I don't need his money
Bitch I got enough

Flo Milli shit!
Pretty bitch walk in they gonna salute
I don't wanna talk bitch
Just keep it cute
Big yellow coupe, no top on the roof
Brush my hair when I walk in the booth
