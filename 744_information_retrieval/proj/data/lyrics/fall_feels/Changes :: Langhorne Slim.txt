Things could be stranger but I don't know how
I'm going through changes now
I've spent a lifetime trying to figure it out
I'm going through changes now

And I've just begun under a purple sun
There's many reasons we are what we've become
I'm going through changes, ripping out pages
I'm going through changes now

I knew it once, but I forgot
I'm going through changes now
We want everything but what we've got
I'm going through changes now

Maybe it's too soon under a purple moon
But I'd ride off with you in a big balloon
I'm going through changes, rattling cages
I'm going through changes now

Things could be different but I don't know how
I'm going through changes, through all of the strangeness
I'm going through changes now
