Been searching for someone of my own kind
Played it back and forth, prefer to rewind
You've been living your life from the outside
Like a stranger inside of your own mind

Both been on the rise and fall
Buried in a tomb and lost
Like past visions of Osiris
Now

I walked into your life at the wrong time
Never quite been perceptive of real life
It was not your fault or a fault of mine
But it's hard to let you go this time

Both been on the rise and fall
Buried in a tomb and lost
Like past visions of Osiris
Now

You were on my lap
I felt your heartbeat
As you pressed your chest hard against me
It was not of this world or of a dream
For the first time someone else loved me
