Caroline
You don't have to lose your mind
Just be sure that you're on time to your next two appointments
Caroline
Amber hair and big blue eyes
Locks herself behind the light and spins her favorite records

'Cause she's got some dreams in her heart
She just needs somewhere to start

I don't wanna be the one to tell you
You don't need to be the last to know
Got big dreams and an attitude
Everything you need, what you need to do is go
Just go
(Can you hear me? I just need to know)

Caroline
Standing on the starting line
Foot slipped out and you fell down a mile from the finish
Caroline
Comin' here at 4 foot 9
Everybody talks so big, but you don't have to listen

'Cause you've got some dreams and some cash
You just need somewhere to crash

And I don't wanna be the one to tell you
You don't need to be the last to know
Got big dreams and an attitude
Everything you need, what you need to do is go
Just go

Caroline
Know you're gonna be just fine
But your name belongs in lights with all the constellation
Change is hard
But it's gonna take you far
Pick up your guitar and tell me why you're so frustrated
