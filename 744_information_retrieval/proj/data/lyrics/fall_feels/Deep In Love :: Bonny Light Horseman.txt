Down in the valley, the first of May
Gatherin' flowers, both fresh and gay
Gatherin' flowers, both red and blue
How little thought of what, what love could do

Don't you break my heart
Don't you break my heart

I put my hand in, into the bush
Finding the sweetest, sweetest rose
I pricked my finger deep to the line
And left the sweetest rose, sweetest rose behind

Don't you break my heart
Don't you break my heart

Saw a ship sailin' on the big blue sea
She sailed as deep as, deep as she could be
But not so deep in, in love as I am
I cannot whether I, I sink or swim

Don't you break my heart
Don't you break my heart

Thousands and thousands all on this Earth
