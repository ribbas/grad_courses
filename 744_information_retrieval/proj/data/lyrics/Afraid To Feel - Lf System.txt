Oh, you see the flames of burning passion
When I look in your eyes
Yes, yes, oh, yes
Are you afraid to feel what you know is real?
Like any other guy

Oh, babe, I'm the flames of burning passion
When I look in your eyes
Yes, yes, oh, yes
Are you afraid to feel what you know is real?
Like any other guy

Oh, can you see the flames of burning passion
When I look in your eyes?
Yes, yes, oh, yes
Are you afraid to feel what you know is real?
Like any other guy

Oh, playing with my heart will get you nothing
You've got to come on inside
My heart's an open door, who could ask for more?
Come on in for a ride

Can't stop (Can't stop) what I'm doing (What I'm doing), what I'm doing to you
Can't stop turning you on

Oh, you see the flames of burning passion
When I look in your eyes
Yes, yes, oh, yes
Are you afraid to feel what you know is real?
Like any other guy

Oh, playing with my heart will get you nothing
You've got to come on inside
My heart's an open door, who could ask for more?
Come on in for a ride

Can't stop (Can't stop) what I'm doing (What I'm doing), what I'm doing to you
Can't stop turning you on

Can't stop (Can't stop) what I'm doing (What I'm doing), what I'm doing to you
Can't stop turning you on

Oh, you see the flames of burning passion
When I look in your eyes
Yes, yes, oh, yes
Are you afraid to feel what you know is real?
Like any other guy

Oh, playing with my heart will get you nothing
You've got to come on inside
My heart's an open door, who could ask for more?
Come on in for a ride

Can't stop (Can't stop) what I'm doing (What I'm doing), what I'm doing to you
Can't stop turning you on
