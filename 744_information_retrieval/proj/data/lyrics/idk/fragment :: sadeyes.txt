I love when you're cool
I love when you care
But I hate when you talk
Like I'm not really there

And you're not who you were
No you're not even close
You're a fragment of her
No you're more like a ghost

When you kiss me
Do you feel like you're still with me
Or are you somewhere else
(Somewhere else, somewhere else in time)

When you kiss me
Do you feel like you're still in the city
Or are you somewhere else
(Somewhere else in time)

I love when you're cool
I love when you care
But I hate when you talk
Like I'm not really there

And you're not who you were
No you're not even close
You're a fragment of her
No you're more like a ghost

I get lost
And I feel like it happens it happens a lot
I get lost
And I feel like I'm stirring the pot

When I ask where you've been
And you tell me to stop
The person you're with
The person you're not, so

I love when you're cool
I love when you care
But I hate when you talk
Like I'm not really there

And you're not who you were
No you're not even close
You're a fragment of her
No you're more like a ghost

I love when you're cool
I love when you care
But I hate when you talk
Like I'm not really there

And you're not who you were
No you're not even close
You're a fragment of her
No you're more like a ghost
