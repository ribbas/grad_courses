It's the ways I'm medicating
It's the apps for meditating
It's the way they never work
It's the high I'm always chasing
It's the friends I'm never making
It's the people that I've hurt

But I don't need therapy
Just someone who's there for me
'Cause that's all that really matters anymore
And I don't need Jesus Christ
Just someone who treats me right
'Cause that's all that really matters anymore

It's the one-way conversations
It's the wasted reservations
It's the dates that never showed
(They never did)
It's the drink that I had two of
It's the girls I've had a few of
It's the way they let me know

That I don't need therapy
Just someone who's there for me
'Cause that's all that really matters anymore
And I don't need Jesus Christ
Just someone who treats me right
'Cause that's all that really matters anymore

And I don't need Novocaine
Just someone who numbs the pain
I guess you're all that really matters
You're all that really matters
Anymore
