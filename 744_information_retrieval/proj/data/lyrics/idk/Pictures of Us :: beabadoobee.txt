Pictures of us
Buildings and rust

I don't know what it means to get better
Last night's emergency
Her and me

She reminded me that God starts with a capital
But I don't think I could do it all
No, I don't think I could do it
She reminded me that God starts with a capital
But I don't think I could do it all
No, I don't think I could do it

And I don't know what it means to get better
Last night's emergency
Her and me

She reminded me that God starts with a capital
But I don't think I could do it all
No, I don't think I could do it
She reminded me that God starts with a capital
But I don't think I could do it all
No, I don't think I could do it

She reminded me that God starts with a capital
But I don't think I could do it
No, I don't think I could do it
She reminded me that God starts with a capital
But I don't think I could do it
No, I don't think I could do it
