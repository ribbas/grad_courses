You lost your dog in oceanside
Skin as sharp as a porcupine
Why are we so mortified
To give it another try

I see you in your mothers eyes
My skin is sharp like a porcupine
Why are we so mortified
To give it another try

I don't care
I just want to
I don't care

Sleeping in the garden
Drinking on the weekend
Cover me in blankets
Hold me like a secret

Standing in the kitchen
Everything is broken
Wonder what's behind this
Door I never open

Everybody's watching
No one pays attention
I don't think I'm sick
But I think it's an infection

Everything's a pattern
Living is a sequence
Drowning in a tidepool
Kiss me in the deep end

But I don't care
I just want to
Touch your hair
And be beside you
I don't care
I just like you
I'll cut your hair
I'll run away with you

You lost your dog in oceanside
Skin as sharp as a porcupine
Why are we so mortified
To give it another try

You lost your dog in oceanside
Skin as sharp as a porcupine
Why are we so mortified
To give it another try, another try

You lost your dog in oceanside
Skin as sharp as a porcupine
Why are we so mortified
To give it another try, another try
