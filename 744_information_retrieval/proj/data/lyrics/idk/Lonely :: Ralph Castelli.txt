Tie me down
I'd rather be here than lonely
You can lock me up
And throw the key away
I'm stuck here now
And these chains aren't so comfy
But with you by my side
The pain will go away

If I try to free myself, tie them tighter and
Let no one else come near
All I need is you
And if I try to free myself, you can
Sing this song and let no one else come hear
What I wrote for you

You're better, you're all that I know
So go ahead
And tie me down
You're better, you're all that I know
There's no one else
For me now

Tie me down
I'd rather be here than lonely
You can lock me up
And throw the key away
I'm stuck here now
And these chains aren't so comfy
But with you by my side
The pain will go away

If I try to free myself, tie them tighter and
Let no one else come near
All I need is you
And if I try to free myself, you can
Sing this song and let no one else come hear
What I wrote for you

You're better, you're all that I know
So go ahead
And tie me down
You're better, you're all that I know
There's no one else
For me now
You're better, you're all that I know
So go ahead
And tie me down
You're better, you're all that I know
There's no one else
For me now
