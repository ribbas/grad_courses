Hide me there
Under the leaves
9 going on 18
Lay it on me
Tell me a story
About how it ends
Where you're still the good guy
I'll make pretend
Cause I hate this story
Where happiness ends
And dies with you

I thought good guys get to be happy
I'm not happy
I am poison in the water and unhappy
Little girl who needs her daddy real bad

In the corner
On my birthday
You watched me
Dancing right there in the grass
I was too young
To notice
That some types of love could be bad
Praying I'd be like you
Doing all of the things that you do
And I still do
And that scares me

I'm tired of you, still tied to me
(Bleeding whenever you want)
Too tired to move, too tired to leave
I'm tired of you, still tied to me
(It's just the way that you are)
I'm tired of you, too tired to leave
(I just wanna sleep)
I'm tired of you, still tied to me
(I just wanna sleep)
Too tired to move, too tired to leave
(I just wanna sleep)
I'm tired of you, still tied to me
(Please, can I sleep, can I sleep?)
I'm tired of you, too tired to leave
I'm tired of you, still tied to me
Too tired to move, too tired to leave
