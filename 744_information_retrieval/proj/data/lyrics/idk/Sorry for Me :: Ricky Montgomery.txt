Tuesday, in the morning
I walk outside to a police car
Pulling up to my yard
Goodbye dear stepfather
I punch my fist right through the wall

Now that it's over
I don't know how to feel
Moving to California
Where I won't have to deal

So, watcha think?
Do you think it would make you sad?
Watcha think?
Do you think it would make you sorry?
Well, I'm sorry
I wouldn't want to make you sorry
For me

Wednesday, in the morning
I walk downstairs
To the sound of my mother and my sister crying
Chain-smoking cigarettes
Foot to the floor of my car
As I go to confront you

Now that it's over
I don't know how to feel
Moving to California
Where I won't have to deal

So, watcha think?
Do you think it would make you sad?
Watcha think?
Do you think it would make you sorry?
Well, I'm sorry
I wouldn't want to make you sorry
I'm sorry
I wouldn't want to make you sorry
I'm sorry
I wouldn't want to make you sorry
For me
