See the bugs in the light
See a hundred staring eyes
Love was a lie I wish I believed in

And then this must be art
I see relief and I hear alarms
It could just be the night, or maybe the season

Oh you'd better slow down or I'll lose my mind
I have this bad habit of falling behind
Oh you better slow down or I might go insane
I have this bad feeling I won't feel the same
So you better slow down for me

My thoughts and my brain
I'll leave as my final remains
I'd sell your bet, I'm not worth the cost

There's a key on the steps
And the back door leads into my head
I'll make the bed
If you turn the lights off

Oh you'd better slow down or I'll lose my mind
I have this bad habit of falling behind
Oh you better slow down or I might go insane
I have this bad feeling I won't feel the same
So you better slow down for me

You'd better slow down
(Love was a lie I don't believe in I wish I believed in)
Or I'll lose my mind I have this bad habit of falling behind
Oh you better slow down or I might go insane
(Love was a lie I don't believe in I wish I believed it)
I have this bad feeling I won't feel the same
So you'd better slow down
You'd better slow down
You'd better slow down
Oh, you'd better slow down
