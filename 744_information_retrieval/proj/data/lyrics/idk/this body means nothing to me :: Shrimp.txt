They say they saw him with a gun
They think he'll stop but they don't know
There's people talking in the dark
They seem to care
And I keep falling in and out
And it leaves me rotten
But I doubt he's had enough
Had enough, had enough

Feels like I'm standing on the outside
Looking in
And I know this body's not mine
To begin with
I wish that I could crawl out
My skin
And see the world
And I promise this is the last time
I admit it
These days just seem to pass by
In a minute
A pistol and a small town
We've seen it all before

And I just wish I could go outside
Without this fear of harm
And I should probably see a counselor
Cause I don't feel too well
And why am I always the bad guy
When I just try to help
This body means nothing to me
At all
