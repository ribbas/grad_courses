I can't wait no longer
Would you say something?
I can't wait no longer

D-D-Dropped out, I was 17
Wasting all my money, mixing dope and LSD
Man, mama said "Don't get ahead of me"
But I don't wanna finish college, I got hella dreams
Well, I don't know what's gotten into me
Ever since I stopped pretending, it was history
Dropped out, I was 17
Now I've got more freedom than I've ever seen

Life don't have directions
And I been tryin' to quarantine
The thought of heaven in the meantime
I've realized I've been there before
All the doors are closed
Wanted so much more
Now it's nice to know
There's no enemy
Or a victory
It's all costumes, funny dances to-
I can do everything

D-D-Dropped out, I was 17
Wasting all my money, mixing dope and LSD
Man, mama said, "don't get ahead of me"
But I don't wanna finish college, I got hella dreams
Well, I don't know what's gotten into me
Ever since I stopped pretending, it was history
Dropped out, I was 17
Now I've got more freedom than I've ever seen
What other effects?

I-I-I love my mama
Don't wanna be apart, man
My brothers say just go get an apartment
Flipping the pages to get into the garden
By now the mara taller, treat me like a God, damn
Feelings rolled up and it's 'bout time
Exhale in the ninth cloud, cloud nine
I got money, I'll expand on it
Cancel your plans, authority couldn't handle us

Okay, this the type shit that make my hands fall asleep
Low blood sugar and some more caffeine
I don't need loving but I want that cheap
So much luck that I've laughed to pieces

Looked inside for some consolation
I found a bi dime in his prime, embraced it, I
Learned it was never complicated
You are who you are, don't keep you waiting
I said you are who you are, don't keep you waiting
(I can't wait no longer)
I said you
(Won't you say something)
I said you are who you are, man
(I can't wait no longer)

Dropped out, I was 17
Wasting all my money, buying 1P-LSD
Mama said, "don't get ahead of me"
Well I don't wanna finish college, I got hella dreams
I don't know what's gotten into me
Ever since I stopped pretending, it was history
Dropped out, I was 17
Now I've got more freedom than I ever seen
