I once believed in everything lasting forever
But sometimes it's not the time, and it's alright to stop
Heaven knows why it never goes how we want it to
Oh, I wish I felt it for you

But I've got issues with everything and everyone
We need to talk
No, it's not your fault I'm in the state I'm in
I'm out of love
Don't know where to start
But we need to talk

I know we've tried a thousand times to make it work out
And everything that we try to say has all been said
Heaven knows why it never goes how we want it to
But I'll always feel it for you

And I've got issues with everything and everyone
We need to talk
No, it's not your fault I'm in the state I'm in
I'm out of love
Don't know where to start
But we need to talk

And if we say goodbye it's gonna hurt you
It's gonna hurt me
And though it don't feel right
We try and push through
Like we're happy
Maybe down the line I'm gonna know you
But I won't

While I've got issues with everything and everyone
We need to talk
No, it's not your fault I'm in the state I'm in
I'm out of love
Don't know where to start
But we need to talk
