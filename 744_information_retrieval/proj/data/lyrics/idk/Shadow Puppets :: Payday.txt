I'm a softy I pretend like I'm the toughest
My brain is loud when I'm alone and I can't hush it
My life is great but sometimes it gets hard to love it
When I'm so lonely I'm playin' with shadow puppets

Lights on lights on
Lights off lights off
I got no one who wants to talk to me
I'm a cry baby
Now it's hard to see
Flashlight ran out of the batteries
Now I'm in the dark and I'm on my own
Yeah, I'm all alone ain't finna check my phone

I'm a softy I pretend like I'm the toughest
My brain is loud when I'm alone and I can't hush it
My life is great but sometimes it gets hard to love it
When I'm so lonely I'm playin' with shadow puppets

I don't wanna be here anymore
I feel empty to the core
Layin' down flat on my bed
Got a lot of thoughts runnin' through my head
Spinnin' in these circles like my ceiling fan
Chillin' all alone like you know I am
Wishin' there was someone who could hold my hand
Shadows on my wall like peter pan

I'm a softy I pretend like I'm the toughest
My brain is loud when I'm alone and I can't hush it
My life is great but sometimes it gets hard to love it
When I'm so lonely I'm playin' with shadow puppets
I'm a softy I pretend like I'm the toughest
My brain is loud when I'm alone and I can't hush it
My life is great but sometimes it gets hard to love it
When I'm so lonely I'm playin' with shadow puppets

So low and I'm solo
Everybody think they know what they don't know
Everybody smile for the photo
Make you take a while so they don't go
Don't go please stay
I can't make it by myself
Don't blow me away
I'm not like nobody else

I'm a softy I pretend like I'm the toughest
My brain is loud when I'm alone and I can't hush it
My life is great but sometimes it gets hard to love it
When I'm so lonely I'm playin' with shadow puppets
