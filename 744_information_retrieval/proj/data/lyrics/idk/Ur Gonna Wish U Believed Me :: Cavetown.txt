You're gonna wish you believed me
God, I wish I was happy
The frayed threads of recovery
Crushing me from above and underneath
You're gonna wish you believed me

Fell asleep in the kitchen
Slowly dissolving into my seat
I don't wanna be hungry
But nobody'll listen
Except for the friend I'm imagining
Curled up in my laundry

You're gonna wish you believed me
God, I wish I was happy
The frayed threads of recovery
Crushing me from above and underneath
You're gonna wish you believed me

I'm sorry for exploding
I said some things I didn't mean
And I don't know what came over me
It's just that I'm really hurting (It's just that I'm really hurting)
It's boiling above the Sertraline
Colliding into the concrete

You're gonna wish you believed me
God, I wish I was happy
The frayed threads of recovery
Crushing me from above and underneath
You're gonna wish you believed me

You're gonna wish you believed me
God, I wish I was happy
The frayed threads of recovery
Crushing me from above and underneath
You're gonna wish you believed me
