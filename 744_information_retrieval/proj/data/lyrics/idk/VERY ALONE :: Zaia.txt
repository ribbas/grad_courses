Don't let nobody
Don't let nobody
Don't let nobody
Don't let nobody
Don't let nobody
Don't let nobody
Don't let nobody

Had a plan, be the man, wanted friends, wanted in
Even then I could never get through
When I made some, back of the pack in school
Even then feelin' like a lone wolf
Tried to change, rearrange, do thangs that I knew
Any other time that I wouldn't do
I'll pretend I'm just tryna be cool
Only cool thing to do is be you

Don't let nobody
Don't let nobody
Don't let nobody
Don't let nobody
Don't let nobody
Don't let nobody

Had a plan, be the man, wanted friends, wanted in
Even then I could never get through
When I made some, back of the pack in school
I'd pack my bags, I'd move
And again and again 'til it seemed endless
And it seemed there was nothing I'd do
I'm just tryna be cool
Cool thing to be is you

Don't let nobody
Don't let nobody
Don't let nobody

Don't let nobody
Don't let nobody
Don't let nobody
