I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
Oh, and I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
Oh, and I wouldn't ask you to take care of me (I think I'm losing you)

Sores appear 'round my neck, don't get close to me
Ask about your life, still in the nose-bleeds?
Laying in your bed, call it intimacy
Wish I could get past the security
Wonder why I wake up living in a made-up
Dream of you and I, together there
Baby, wake the fuck up
Time for you to grow up
Don't you know that life is rarely ever fair?

I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
Oh, and I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
Oh, and I wouldn't ask you to take care of me

Tell you how I feel, I keep it real clean
Lock hanging 'round my neck, you don't get a key
Come a little closer, I'll show you what I mean
Oh, boy, no, it's all for me
Ice cold, baby, I'm ice cold
You're the only one who could make me thaw
Ice cold, baby, I'm ice cold
You're the only one who could make me thaw

I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
Oh, I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
Oh, I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
Oh, I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
Oh, I wouldn't ask you to take care of me

I wouldn't ask you, baby
I wouldn't ask you, baby
To be the one I love
To be the one I love, I love
We could be
We could be so strong
We'll be alright, we'll be alright
We could be so strong
We'll be alright, we'll be alright
We could be so strong
We'll be alright, we'll be alright
Caught me by surprise
Everything I need in my life
I wanna call you mine
I wanna be intertwined
We could be so strong
We'll be alright, we'll be alright
We could be so strong
We'll be alright, we'll be alright
We could be so strong
We'll be alright, we'll be alright
Feels like I've known you for so long
Without you, I don't feel strong
Feels like I've known you for so long
Without you, I don't feel so strong
So strong
We could be so strong
