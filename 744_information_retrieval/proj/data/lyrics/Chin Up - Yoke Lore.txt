Your feelings they arrest you
The tragic they will bless you
You don't respect the past
And you think the world's unsafe

And you think that you gotta act
Like you're at peace with all of the facts
But I know that there's much more to you than that
I know that there's much more to you than that

I wish that you were happy in your skin
I wish I that I could show you where the center is
But I believe the sleights are in your head
Cause I will love you long after I'm dead

Chin up, chin up, chin up
Chin up, chin up, chin up
Chin up, chin up, chin up
Chin up, chin up, chin up

You're reeling then he wrecks you
You're thrown out like the refuse
Bleach your hair, live in the sun, make believe you're just like everyone
A little man with a big gun, a little man with a big gun

I wish that you were happy in your skin
I wish I that I could show you where the center is
But I believe the sleights are in your head
Cause I will love you long after I'm dead

Chin up, chin up, chin up
Chin up, chin up, chin up
Chin up, chin up, chin up
Chin up, chin up, chin up
Chin up, chin up, chin up
Chin up, chin up, chin up
Chin up, chin up, chin up
Chin up, chin up, chin up
