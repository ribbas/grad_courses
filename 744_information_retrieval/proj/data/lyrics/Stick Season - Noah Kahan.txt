As you promised me that I was more than all the miles combined
You must have had yourself a change of heart like halfway through the drive
Because your voice trailed off exactly as you passed my exit sign
Kept on driving straight and left our future to the right

Now I am stuck between my anger and the blame that I can't face
And memories are something even smoking weed does not replace
And I am terrified of weather 'cause I see you when it rains
And doc told me to travel but there's COVID on the planes

And I, love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks
And I, saw your mom, she forgot that I existed
And it's, half my fault but I just like to play the victim
I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas
And I'll, dream each night of some version of you
That I, might not have but I did not lose
Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes
And I'm split in half but that'll have to do

So I thought that if I piled something good on all my bad
That I could cancel out the darkness I inherited from dad
No and I'm no longer funny but I miss the way you laugh
You once called me forever now you still can't call me back

And I, love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks
And I, saw your mom, she forgot that I existed
And it's half my fault but I just like to play the victim
I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas
And I'll, dream each night of some version of you
That I, might not have but I did not lose
Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes
And I'm split in half but that'll have to do

Oh that'll have to do
My other half was you
I hope this pain's just passing through
But I doubt it

And I, love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks
And I, saw your mom, she forgot that I existed
And it's half my fault but I just like to play the victim
I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas
And I'll, dream each night of some version of you
That I, might not have but I did not lose
Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes
And I'm split in half but that'll have to do
Have to do
