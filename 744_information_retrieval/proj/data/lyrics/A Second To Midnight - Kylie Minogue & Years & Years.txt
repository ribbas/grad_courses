Tick tick tick
Tick tick

Remember back in 99'? Oh, I
We danced like maniacs all night, oh, I
Now the world is turning
Faster with time
And I'm slowly going out of my mind
Yeah, I, I think we're the same
Yeah, think we're the same

And oh-oh, where do we go, oh?
I gotta know, show me your page
Cause the clock's keeps ticking the tock
I ain't gonna stop, no how, no way

I'm chasing after midnight
Show me the way to your heart
Ready for the start of my real life
To shine like a light in the dark
Waiting for this moment to work right for you
I'm done hesitating
Oh yeah, only got a second to midnight

(Show me the way to your heart)
Ooh

I wonder if you question why, oh, I
We left our fantasy behind, oh why? (Oh why?)
Now the world is turning
Faster with time
And I'm slowly going out of my mind
Yeah, I (Oh, I)
I think we're the same, yeah
I think we're the same

And oh-oh, where do we go, oh?
I gotta know, show me your page
Cause the clock's keep ticking the tock
I ain't gonna stop, no how, no way

I'm chasing after midnight
Show me the way to your heart
Ready for the start of my real life (Real life)
To shine like a light in the dark
Waiting for this moment to work right for you (Oh yeah)
I'm done hesitating
Oh yeah, only got a second to midnight

So love, run
Freedom
Go on
Get some (Oh, get some)
Dig (Dig!), deep (deep!)
Let (Let!), go (go!)
Oh (Oh!), oh (oh!)
Oh
Yeah

I'm chasing after midnight
Show me the way to your heart (Yeah, yeah)
Ready for the start of my real life (Real life)
To shine like a light in the dark (Shine)
Waiting for this moment to work right for you (I'm waiting)
I'm done hesitating
Oh yeah, only got a second to midnight
