Oh yeah, yeah...

Open up your heart, what do you feel
Open up your heart, what do you feel is real

The big bang may be a million years away
But I can't think of a better time to say

World, hold on
Instead of messing with our future, open up inside
World, hold on
One day you will have to answer to the children of the sky

World, hold on
Instead of messing with our future
Tell me no more lies
World, hold on
One day you will have to answer to the children of the sky

Children of the sky
Children of the sky
Look inside, you'll find a deeper love
The kind that only comes from high above

If you ever meet your inner child, don't cry
Tell them everything is gonna be alright

World, hold on
Instead of messing with our future, open up inside
World, hold on
One day you will have to answer to the children of the sky

World, hold on
Come one, everybody in the universe, come on
World, hold on
One day you will have to answer to the children of the sky

Alright, everybody, here in the world

Together now, unite, and fight oooh
Open up you heart, no, peace, love for everyone
