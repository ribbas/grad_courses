Crybaby, serial heartbreaker
Don't blame me, it's just the way God made her

So many questions
That's too many for me
So many lessons
So many girl of my dreams

'Cause I tend to over complicate
I over love, I under play it
Get myself in situations
Different people, different places
Sensitive but not enough
I'm not the best at breaking up
Too soon to rip the Band-Aid off
A sucker for the fuck me up

Crybaby, serial heartbreaker (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
Don't blame me, it's just the way God made her (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
Whoa-oh-oh, serial heartbreaker
Oh-oh-oh, it's just the way
It's just the way God made her

I like my alone time
But I want somebody to hold
I get what I want, I
I keep it for a minute, then I let go

'Cause I tend to contradict a lot
I love you more, I love you not
I hate it when you're there for me
I like it when you hit the spot
Every time, I share too much
You get in close and I give up
So hurry, rip the Band-Aid off
Hurry baby, fuck me up

Crybaby, serial heartbreaker (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
Don't blame me, it's just the way God made her (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
Whoa-oh-oh, serial heartbreaker
Oh-oh-oh, it's just the way
It's just the way God made her

Whoa-oh-oh, serial heartbreaker
Oh-oh-oh, it's just the way God made her

I like my alone time
But I want somebody to hold
