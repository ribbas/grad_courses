We can let go, we can dance all night
Pull your body close to me
It's a different kind of 9-5
Coz right now we don't wanna leave

Feel the mercury taking over me
I know you feel it too
Bodies in the heat, we don't ever sleep
When I'm next to you

Take me to the sunshine
I wanna give my heart away, yeah
Tell me when the bass line
Is deeper in my soul again, yeah
I'll love you til the morning, baby
Let you take my fears away, yeah
So take me to the sunshine
I wanna give my heart away

Take me to the sunshine
Take me to the sunshine

It's a different kind of state of mind
Chasing stars and catching feels
Going under like we hypnotized
For a moment it ain't real

Feel the mercury taking over me
I know you feel it too
Bodies in the heat, we don't ever sleep
When I'm next to you

Take me to the sunshine
I wanna give my heart away, yeah
Tell me when the bass line
Is deeper in my soul again, yeah
I'll love you til the morning, baby
Let you take my fears away, yeah
So take me to the sunshine
I wanna give my heart away

Take me to the sunshine
Take me to the sunshine
Take me to the sunshine
Take me to the sunshine, yeah
