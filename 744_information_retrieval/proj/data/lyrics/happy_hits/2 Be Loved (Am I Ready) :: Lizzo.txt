On other hand, I know my worth (Ah, ah)

'Cause I want it (That's what I'm talkin' about)
Am I ready? (You gon' figure it out)
To be loved, to be loved

How am I supposed to love somebody else (Sheesh, sheesh, sheesh)
When I don't like myself, like ooh?
Guess I better learn to like this, ooh (Try)
It might take my whole life just to do (Damn, hey, hey)

He call me Melly (Aye)
He squeeze my belly (Yeah)
I'm too embarrassed
To say I like it
Girl, is this my boo? (Is this my boo?)
