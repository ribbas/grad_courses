You and I were on top of the world
From July 'til September the 3rd
You and me were special
Yeah we were special

It got colder and the colder it got
Something else made it's way in our hearts
Didn't feel as special
Until we weren't special

It's been a while
6 months later I can say I ain't
Bitter now
But every now and again I remember how

We were dancing on a sunny day
But when the beat dropped, nothing played
We're the ones that got away
But for a minute we were dancing on a sunny day

It took a while for me but now I know
I think I'm on my way to letting go
We were young and it's okay
But for a minute we were dancing on a sunny day

Everybody's scared of being alone
So we started leading lives of our own
Yeah we hurt each other
Didn't deserve one another

It's like I had to lose it all to wake up
To get a new point of view of what's love
And I see it
This time I mean it

We were dancing on a sunny day
But when the beat dropped, nothing played
We're the ones that got away
But for a minute we were dancing on a sunny day

It took a while for me but now I know
I think I'm on my way to letting go
We were young and it's okay
But for a minute we were dancing on a sunny day

Are you happy?
Cause I'm happy
Your smile will start to fade away
Sometimes I wish I'd stop to stay
I'm sorry
But I'm not sorry
It's our story
It was always gonna end up this way

We were dancing on a sunny day
But when the beat dropped, nothing played
We're the ones, that got away
But for a minute we were dancing on a sunny day

It took a while for me but now I know
I think I'm on my way to letting go
We were young and it's okay
But for a minute we were dancing on a sunny day
