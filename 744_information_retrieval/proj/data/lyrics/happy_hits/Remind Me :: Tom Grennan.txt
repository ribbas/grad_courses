Millions of hours become days
Your pictures that keep me awake
I was tryin' to find ya, to see if the love was still the same
Visions of us that don't fade
We were holdin' on, hopin' it don't break
But now that we're dancing, it's all coming back to me

There was something good we lost along the way (Oh yeah, yeah)
And the melody is just not quite the same

I said, "I can't sing along
'Cause I forgot the song
So how does it go?
Could you please remind me? (Please remind me)
Could you please remind me?" (Please remind me)
She said, "I don't even know
'Cause I forgot our song
Thought I was alone
Would you please remind me? (Please remind me)
Would you please remind me?" (Please remind me)

And did it go
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh?
Or did it go
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh?
I think it went
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Could you please remind me?

I needed the time to find me
I made a mistake, and I'm sorry (Woah-oh-oh)
If we try this again, I promise that I will never leave (No, I won't)

There was something good we lost along the way (Oh yeah, yeah)
And the melody is just not quite the same

I said, "I can't sing along
'Cause I forgot the song
So how does it go?
Could you please remind me? (Please remind me)
Could you please remind me?" (Please remind me)
She said, "I don't even know
'Cause I forgot our song
Thought I was alone
Would you please remind me? (Please remind me)
Would you please remind me?" (Please remind me)

And did it go
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh?
Or did it go
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh?
I think it went
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Could you please remind me?

Remind me of all of those nights
And all those of fights
And all of those times we said goodbye
All I'm asking is why
Would you please remind me?

She said, "I don't even know
'Cause I forgot our song
Thought I was alone
Would you please remind me? (Please remind me)
Would you please remind me?" (Please remind me)

Darling, tell me, did it go
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh?
Or did it go
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh?
I think it went
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Could you please remind me?
