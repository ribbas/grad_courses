I need at least three pictures of you in that outfit
Lip out, pouting
Don't forget the flash, you can't go without it
Take it in a mirror
Wipe it clear
We staying in bed for a whole year

I need three pictures of you in a towel
Fresh out the shower
I'll be home in a couple hours
Moaned your name last night
Tonight you better make me moan it louder, moan it louder

You can be my supermodel
You can be my super lady
You can be my super woman
Fuck it, you can have my babies

What if you never went back home to your place?
Feeding me grapes up in the kitchen, smile stuck on your face
Folding your laundry like the way you taught me when you learned young
Don't go to the parties just for fun, we can get tipsy, kinda drunk
Wait, hold up
Babe, you knocking me off my axis, why do I love your fashion?
Now I love shows with captions even though I don't like them
But I won't ever fight it
You can make me crochet some shit
Don't care what time or place it is
'Cause I always needed me and you

I need at least three pictures of you in that outfit
Lip out, pouting
Don't forget the flash, you can't go without it
Take it in a mirror
Wipe it clear
We staying in bed for a whole year

I need three pictures of you in a towel
Fresh out the shower
I'll be home in a couple hours
Moaned your name last night
Tonight you better make me moan it louder, moan it louder

I'ma take you to the left coast
We can walk out in the ocean
Loving all up on each other
Get higher than the mountains

Can you break my fall?
Blood on both my knees
Don't you miss my call, my call
Need you there for me
I need you there for me

So touch me like I'm gone
Fingerprint my skin
Tattoo on your love
And I'll do it again
So touch me like I'm gone
Fingerprint my skin
Tattoo on your love
And I'll do it again

I need at least three kisses from you in the morning
While you're yawning
You're so good that, baby, you could be a drawing
You some artwork, more than I'm worth
And everybody ever living on this big blue earth

Need to hear that four-letter word in your tonsils
Right when I call ya
You never know, I could die tomorrow
Or the next day, in the worst way
Baby, can you come save me, uh, come save me?

Come save me
Ah yeah
Come save me, baby
Come save me, baby
Come, come save me
Come, come, come save me
Come, yeah, come save me
