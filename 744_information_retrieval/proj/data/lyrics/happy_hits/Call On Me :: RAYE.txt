You can call on me

Call my name when you're alone
And when you need, I'm by the phone
And I'll share blame if lies are true
If you go down, I'm coming, too

Keep holding on, I'll run to you
I know that it's hard sometimes to be so fucking patient
Stay where you are, I'll come to you
I'ma come and get you, baby, send me your location

Call on me, oh
Oh, I will be there if you ask me to
Call on me, oh
Everything that hurts you hurts me, too

So you can call on me (Uh-huh)
You can call on me (Uh-huh)
You can call on me (Uh-huh)
You can call on me (Uh-huh)

Hold my hand when you're in fear
And when you're far, I'll keep you near
Two white wines to catch your tears
I'll hold you down for all my years

Keep holding on (Keep holding on), I'll run to you (I'll run to you)
I know that it's hard sometimes to be so fucking patient
Stay where you are (Stay where you are), I'll come to you (I'll come to you)
I'ma come and get you, baby, send me your location

Call on me, oh
Oh, I will be there if you ask me to
Call on me, oh
Everything that hurts you, it hurts me, too

So you can call on me (Uh-huh)
You can call on me (Uh-huh)
You can call on me (Uh-huh)
You can call on me (Uh-huh)

Late at night, I think of you
And all the things that we've been through
And I don't know what I would do without you in my life
Oh, can't you see?
Oh, call on me, hey
Oh, I will be there if you ask me to, oh
Call on me, oh
Everything that hurts you, it hurts me too, oh

Call on me, oh
Oh, I will be there if you ask me to
Call on me, oh
Everything that hurts you hurts me, too

So you can call on me (Uh-huh)
You can call on me (Uh-huh)
You can call on me (Uh-huh)
You can call on me (Uh-huh)
