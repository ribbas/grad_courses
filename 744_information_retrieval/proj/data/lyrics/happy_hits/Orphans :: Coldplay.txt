(I want to know when I can go)
(Back and get drunk with my friends?)

Boom boom ka, buba de ka
Boom boom ka, buba de ka
Boom boom ka, buba de ka

Rosaleem of the Damascene
Yes, she had eyes like the moon
Would have been on the silver screen
But for the missile monsoon
She went, "Woo woo, woo woo oo-oo-oo"
Indigo go up to heaven today
Woo woo, woo woo oo-oo-oo
With bombs going boom ba-boom-boom
She say

I want to know when I can go
Back and get drunk with my friends
I want to know when I can go
Back and be young again

Baba would go where the flowers grow
Almond and peach trees in bloom
And he would know just when and what to sow
So golden and opportune
He went, "Woo woo, woo woo oo-oo-oo"
Tulips the colour of honey today
It's true true, woo woo oo-oo-oo
With bombs going boom ba-boom-boom
He say

Oh I want to know when I can go
Back and get drunk with my friends
I want to know when I can go
Back and be young again (yeah)

Woo woo, woo woo oo-oo-oo
Woo woo, woo woo oo-oo-oo
Cherubim seraphim soon
Come sailing us home by the light of the moon

Oh I want to know when I can go
Back and get drunk with my friends
I want to know when I can go
Back and feel home again

Woo woo, woo woo oo-oo-oo
I guess we'll be raised on our own then
Woo woo, woo woo oo-oo-oo
I want to be with you 'til the world ends
I want to be with you 'til the whole world ends

Boom boom ka, buba de ka
Boom boom ka, buba de ka
Boom boom ka, buba de ka
Boom boom ka, buba de ka
Boom
