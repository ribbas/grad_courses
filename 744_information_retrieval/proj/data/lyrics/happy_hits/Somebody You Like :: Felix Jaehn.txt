You don't know me
D'you wanna dance, dance with me?
Hearts wide open
D'you wanna take, take a chance with me?

I go with the flow to see where it goes
You know you don't know, you know if you don't
Go with the flow to see where it goes
You know you don't know, you know

What if you come with me tonight
Give me just a bit of your time
Maybe you'll come to realise
That I could be somebody, I could be somebody you like

(Ooh yeah)
Somebody you like
(Ooh yeah)

When you hold me
D'you feel the same energy?

Like you could go with the flow to see where it goes
You know you don't know, you know if you don't
Go with the flow to see where it goes
You know you don't know, you know

What if you come with me tonight
Give me just a bit of your time
Maybe you'll come to realise
That I could be somebody, I could be somebody you like

(Ooh yeah)
Somebody you like
(Ooh yeah)

Somebody you like, somebody you like
Somebody you like, somebody
Somebody you like, somebody you like
Somebody you like, somebody
