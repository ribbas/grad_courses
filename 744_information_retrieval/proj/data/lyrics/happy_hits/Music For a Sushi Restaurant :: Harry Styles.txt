(Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine)

Green eyes, fried rice
I could cook an egg on you
Late night, game time
Coffee on the stove, yeah
You're sweet ice cream
But you could use a flake or two
Blue bubblegum twisted round your tongue

I don't want you to get lost
I don't want you to go broke
I want you

It's 'cause I love you, babe
In every kind of way
Just a little taste
You know I love you, baby

"Excuse me, a green tea?"
Music for a sushi restaurant
From ice on rice
Music for a sushi restaurant
Music for a sushi restaurant
Music for whatever you want

I'm not going to get lost
I'm not going to go broke
Staying cool

You know I love you, babe

If the stars were edible
And our hearts were never full
Could we live with just a taste?
Just a taste

It's 'cause I love you, babe
In every kind of way
Just a little taste
You know I love you, baby
