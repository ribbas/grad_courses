I just called
Ah la la la, la la la

Now I'm getting really brave, I've had a few shots
I would say it to your face, but I just can't no more
'Cause you moved so far away, just like a few blocks
Picket fence and perfect girl, even a ring on your door

You'd see me coming, coming, coming from a mile away
I've got something, something, something that I'm dying to say
Yeah, I'm doing pretty great, just thought you should know (Yeah)
No thanks to you, though

I just called to say I hate you (Huh)
I just called to say that I moved on
I just called to say this the last you'll be hearing from me
'Cause now your mailbox full, I can't call you no more

Played the Latto and lost it (Latto)
Got options like my closet (I do)
When I'm off it, I don't double back
Might wear it once, then I'm done with that (Yeah)
I'm the full package, thick and tatted
All your baggage better have Delta taggage
How you bag the baddest, treat it like a savage?
I could do you nasty, but I'm movin' past it (Uh)

These pretty thighs, pretty brown eyes
Don't belong to you no more (No more)
I just called to tell you that I'm cool without you
And I'm doing fine on my own (Yeah)
By the time you get this voicemail, you'll be blocked, so don't bother
One thing about me, I'ma drop 'em quicker than bad service, next caller
Boy, I'm cool

I'm cool, still got a second or two
Might get cut off like the last one
Just in case it didn't go through

I just called to say I hate you
I just called to say that I moved on
Yeah
I just called to say this the last you'll be hearing from me
'Cause now your mailbox full, I can't call you no more

Yeah
'Cause your mailbox full, I can't call you
So I couldn't if I wanted to
Yeah, your mailbox full, I can't call you no more
