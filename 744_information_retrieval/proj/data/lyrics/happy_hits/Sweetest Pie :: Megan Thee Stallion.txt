You've never been to Heaven, have you?

Ooh, this the ride of your life
Hold on 'cause, baby, I might
I might just give you a bite of the sweetest pie
Ooh, baby, we can go fast
I'll drive and you just lay back
I got the flavor that lasts, yeah, the sweetest pie

I might take you home with this
I might give you all of it
Come get your dose of the sweetest pie
Ooh, this the ride of your life
Hold on 'cause, baby, I might
I might just give you a bite of the sweetest pie

Baby, I'm the sweetest
Pussy is the meanest
Hot girl shit, but I'm cold every season
Know he got that pipe, let him bust it till it's leakin'
Booty like a pillow, he can use it while he sleepin'
Look, don't be goin' through my phone 'cause that's the old me
Ain't the only one tryna be my one and only
Real big, movin' slow, that body like codeine
He a player, but for Megan he cuttin' the whole team
That body lookin' nice
I got cake and I know he want a slice
I wish a nigga would try to put me on ice
I ain't ever had to chase dick in my life
I want that nasty, that freaky stuff
Slid up under my bed and keep me up
That Hansel and Gretel, let him eat me up
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

Ooh, this the ride of your life
Hold on 'cause, baby, I might
I might just give you a bite of the sweetest pie
Ooh, baby, we can go fast
I'll drive and you just lay back
I got the flavor that lasts, yeah, the sweetest pie

I might take you home with this
I might give you all of it
Come get your dose of the sweetest pie
Ooh, this the ride of your life
Hold on 'cause, baby, I might
I might just give you a bite of the sweetest pie

You got me hung up from across the room
I'm so high that I'm on another altitude
And on my cloud I got some space for you
Got a taste for you
Ay

More bounce to the ounce
Pick it up, put it down
Wanna put his Nutty Buddy in my Fudge Round
Pussy tighter than a bitch
He ain't had it like this
Toes curling like they throwin' gang signs on Crip
One thing about me, I ain't takin' no shit
He will, I know it's pissin' off his old bitch
Cesar Millan, I got his ass trained
Trouble at the top, now who really runnin' things?
(Who? Ah)

You've never been to Heaven, have you?

Ooh, this the ride of your life
Hold on 'cause, baby, I might
I might just give you a bite of the sweetest pie
Ooh, baby, we can go fast
I'll drive and you just lay back
I got the flavor that lasts, yeah, the sweetest pie

I might take you home with this
I might give you all of it
Come get your dose of the sweetest pie
Ooh, this the ride of your life
Hold on 'cause, baby, I might
I might just give you a bite of the sweetest pie

Real hot girl shit
Me and Dua Lipa finna get the party lit
Ah
