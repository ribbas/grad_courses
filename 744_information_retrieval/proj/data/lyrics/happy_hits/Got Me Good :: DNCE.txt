(You got me good)

We said forever, damn, it happened so fast
Spilling secrets like a champagne glass
I ain't ever caught a feeling like that
So fast, so fast

From the party to the lobby to the bed
From the bed to my heart to my head
I was certain it was love and no less
Oh, yes

But you left with the sun
On some kind of mission
I gave you a meal
You left me with dishes
I can't be that mad
Got what I was giving
Took a page from my book
Damn, baby, you got me good (Ooh)

Had me fooled with all the kisses and the games
When you whispered in my ear if you could stay
I thought it'd be a little longer than a day
No way, no way

What now with the plans that you made?
Mescal and sunsets and big waves
How you so quick with the mood change?

But you left with the sun
On some kind of mission
I gave you a meal
You left me with dishes
I can't be that mad
Got what I was giving
Took a page from my book
Damn, baby, you got me good (Ooh)

Got me good, got me good, got me good (All night)
Got me good, got me good, got me good (All night)
Woohoo, woohoo, woohoo

Guess that's the price
Price that I pay
For falling so hard for you in less than a day
Guess that's the price
Price that I pay
For falling so hard for you in less than a day

But you left with the sun
On some kind of mission
I gave you a meal
You left me with dishes
I can't be that mad
Got what I was giving
Took a page from my book
Damn, baby, you got me good (Ooh)

Got me good, got me good, got me good (All night)
Got me good, got me good, got me good (All night)
Woohoo, woohoo, woohoo
