I should move
Cause New York is getting muddy out
There's LA
But it's always kinda sunny out
And I don't wanna hurt no more
So I set my bar real low

I'm A-okay
I'm A-okay
You say it but you just don't mean it
You're so insane
You're so insane
Shut up and just enjoy this feeling

Don't you love it
Don't you love it
No I ain't happy yet
But I'm way less sad

Don't you love it
Don't you love it
No I ain't happy yet
But I'm way less sad

I wake up
And I'm not so mad at twitter now
Living sucks
But it's sucking just a little now
And I don't wanna cry no more
So I set my bar real low

I'm A-okay
I'm A-okay
You say it but you just don't mean it
You're so insane
You're so insane
Shut up and just enjoy this feeling

Don't you love it
Don't you love it
No I ain't happy yet
But I'm way less sad
Don't you love it
Don't you love it
No I ain't happy yet
But I'm way less sad
I may be wrong
I may be wrong
It's stupid but it's all I have
Don't you love it
Don't you love it
No I ain't happy yet
But I'm way less sad

Well I can't fall asleep
And I'm losing my mind
Cause it's half past three
And my brain's on fire
I been counting sheep
But the sheep all died
And I'm trying too hard
But I can't not try

Well I can't fall asleep
And I'm losing my mind
Cause it's half past three
And my brain's on fire
I been counting sheep
But the sheep all died
And I'm not dead yet
So I guess I'll be alright

Don't you love it
Don't you love it
No I ain't happy yet
But I'm way less sad
Don't you love it
Don't you love it
No I ain't happy yet
But I'm way less sad
I may be wrong
I may be wrong
I may be wrong
I may be wrong
It's stupid but it's all I have
Don't you love it
Don't you love it
No I ain't happy yet
But I'm way less sad
