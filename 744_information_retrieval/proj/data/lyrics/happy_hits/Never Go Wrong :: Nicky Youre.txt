I've seen you in a movie
I heard you in a song
Now I know that this will never go wrong
Like you already knew me
That's why we get along
Yeah, I know that this will never go

Ooh, it's cinematic in the way we connected
Girl, you're so familiar, I never expected
You to be right in my arms and my favorite part
How you talk in the dark, oh god there's

Something 'bout the sound of you is stuck in my head
I'm hopelessly romanticizing all that you said
Even though I see that I'm in too deep
I still gotta let you know that I

Never wanted anyone more
Falling forwards onto the floor
Feels like I've felt this feeling before, before

I've seen you in a movie
I heard you in a song
Now I know that this will never go wrong
Like you already knew me
That's why we get along
Yeah, I know that this will never go
I've seen you in a movie
I heard you in a song
Now I know that this will never go wrong
Like you already knew me
That's why we get along
Yeah, I know that this will never go wrong

This will never go wrong (Oh-oh-ooh)
This will never go wrong (Oh-oh-ooh)
This will never go wrong (Oh-oh-ooh)
This will never go, yeah-yeah, yeah

We can keep on going like we haven't seen the ending
Living in a dream but we're not pretending
I don't wanna wake up
No, I don't want it to stop

Never wanted anyone more
Falling forwards onto the floor
Feels like I've felt this feeling before, before

I've seen you in a movie
I heard you in a song
Now I know that this will never go wrong
Like you already knew me
That's why we get along
Yeah, I know that this will never go
I've seen you in a movie
I heard you in a song
Now I know that this will never go wrong
Like you already knew me
That's why we get along
Yeah, I know that this will never go wrong

This will never go wrong (Oh-oh-ooh)
This will never go wrong (Oh-oh-ooh)
This will never go wrong (Oh-oh-ooh)
This will never go, yeah-yeah, yeah

Wrong (Oh-oh-ooh)
This will never go wrong (Oh-oh-ooh)
This will never go wrong (Oh-oh-ooh)
Yeah, I know that this will never go
This will never go wrong
