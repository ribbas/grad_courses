I can't help it
I get starstruck around you

I feel like all these people in this room
Don't shine like you
If I could bottle you up
I would sip ya like cosmic juice

So gimme that good love
Good good love all night
Don't need your cash
I got my own to spend it on ya if I like
If you wanna dance
Baby let's dance
We can dream until the sunrise

I can't help it
I get starstruck around you
What can I do baby
I can't help it
I get starstruck around you
What can I do

There ain't no reason why
I can't speak, think or stop staring at your glow
I wanna tell ya everything that's on my mind baby
Even if I choke
Ooh, yeah

So gimme that good love
Good good love all night
Don't need your cash
I got my own to spend it on ya if I like
If you wanna dance
Baby let's dance
We can dream until the sunrise

I can't help it
I get starstruck around you
What can I do baby
I can't help it
I get starstruck around you
What can I do (when I got my hands on you)

I'm not giving, not giving you up
I'm not giving, not giving you up
I'm not giving, not giving you up
I'm not giving, not giving you up, up, up, no
I can't help it
I get starstruck around you
What can I do baby

Starstruck
Not giving you up
Starstruck
Not giving you up

I can't help it
I can't help it
I can't help it
I can't help it
I get starstruck around you
What can I do baby
I can't help it
I get starstruck around you
What can I do (oh what can I do)

I'm not giving, not giving you up
I'm not giving, not giving you up
I'm not giving, not giving you up
I'm not giving, not giving you up, up, up, no

I can't help it
I get starstruck around you
What can I do
Starstruck
Not giving you up
