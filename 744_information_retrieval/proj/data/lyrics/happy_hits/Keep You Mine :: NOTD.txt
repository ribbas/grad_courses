(In the middle)

Yes we started a fire, now the bedroom is burnin'
Can we put it out?
'Cause we're both sayin' things that we're gonna regret and
Every word's too loud

We gotta slow, slow, slow down
Get out alone, lone, lone now
Yeah, we should go, go, go now
'Cause things are always better
Things are always better

When you call me back in a little
When the dust starts to settle
All we need is a little time
To keep me yours and keep you mine
Don't be scared if we're fallin'
It hurts less in the mornin'
All we need is a little time
To keep me yours and keep you mine

To keep me yours and keep you mine

There's a curl in this room and I can't cut the tension
'Cause we lost the knife
In the mountain of dishes that my heart is smashin'
We eat out tonight

We gotta slow, slow, slow down
Get out alone, lone, lone now
Yeah, we should go, go, go now
'Cause things are always better
Things are always better

When you call me back in a little
When the dust starts to settle
All we need is a little time
To keep me yours and keep you mine
Don't be scared if we're fallin'
It hurts less in the mornin'
All we need is a little time
To keep me yours and keep you mine

To keep me yours and keep you mine

Call me back in a little
When the dust starts to settle
All we need is a little time
To keep me yours and keep you mine
