Skipping town, down to Mexico
Lipstick on, in the Thunderbird
Let's roll
Drive right off of the world
Leave your job and your gaslight man
Modern life was a big let-down
We're bored, felt like a brick in the wall

Days like these you wanna get away
Close our eyes, pretend we're miles away
Hear the sound of my heart exploding
Can you hear the sound of my heart exploding?

She said to me
Days like these you wanna get away
Close our eyes, pretend we're miles away
Hear the sound of my heart exploding
Oh, oh
Can you hear the sound of my heart exploding?
She said to me

Runaways under big blue skies
Desert winds yeah we made headlines
When you showed him what it means to say no

Days like these you wanna get away
Close our eyes, pretend we're miles away
Hear the sound of my heart exploding
Can you hear the sound of my heart exploding?

She said to me
Days like these you wanna get away
Close our eyes, pretend we're miles away
Hear the sound of my heart exploding
Oh, oh
Can you hear the sound of my heart exploding?

And suddenly we're Thelma and Louise
You said let's get the hell right out of here, oh
Can you hear the sound of my heart exploding?
Oh, oh
Can you hear the sound of my heart exploding?
Days like these
We wanna get away
