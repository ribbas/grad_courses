Every time I see you walk that ocean floor
It feels like you're drifting off from anyone on shore
Every night I see you lost and I want more
I hear you talking but the words don't feel like yours

Tell me, what's been on your mind?
Are we floating on just fine?
Tell me, what's been on your mind?
It's okay to cross that line

Taking the shape of everything that's at your door
Diving too deep in bags they left for you to store
Every night I see you lost and I want more
I hear you talking but the words don't feel like yours

Tell me what's been on your mind?
Are we floating on just fine?
Tell me, what's been on your mind?
It's okay to cross that line
