I was made for loving you, baby
You were made for loving me
And I can't get enough of you, baby
Can you get enough of me?

(Made for love
It's what I'm made for
I can't get enough)

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do

I was made for loving you, baby
You were made for loving me
And I can't get enough of you, baby
Can you get enough of me?

I was made for loving you, baby
You were made for loving me
And I can give it all to you, baby
Can you give it all to me?

(I can't get enough)

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do

I was made for loving you
(Can't get enough)
I was made for love
(Can't get enough)
I can't get enough of you
I can't get enough

I was made for loving you, baby
You were made for loving me
And I can't get enough of you, baby
Can you get enough of me?

I was made for loving you, baby
You were made for loving me
And I can give it all to you, baby
Can you give it all to me?
