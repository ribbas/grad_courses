You were my home planet
You were my stars, my holy place
But you took me for granted
Right from the start now
Didn't you, babe?

And I–
Wish you the best of luck in finding
Someone else who's strong enough
And I–
This is the only time
I can't be keeping you from fucking up

So go ahead and do your worst
But don't you go and cry when it hurts
Can you afford to lose me?
Go ahead and pack your bags
But once you're gone you can't come back
Can you afford to lose me?
And if you've still got that fire
Then prove it to me

I was your life support machine
Didn't you realize it was always me?
I was always there to pick up the pieces
When you were a full-blown catastrophe
Yeah

And I–
Gave you the closest thing you ever had to love so sober up
And this time
This is the final time I'll draw the line
I've suffered long enough

So go ahead and do your worst
But don't you go and cry when it hurts
Can you afford to lose me?
Go ahead and pack your bags
'Cause once you're gone you can't come back
Can you afford to lose me?
And if you've still got that fire
Then prove it to me

Can you sleep without me?
Can you breathe without me?
Don't you need somebody?
Somebody? (Can you?)

Can you sleep without me?
Can you breathe without me? (Oh-ohh)
Don't you need somebody? (Can you afford to?)

Go ahead and do your worst
But don't you go and cry when it hurts
Can you afford to lose me?
Go ahead and pack your bags
'Cause once you're gone you can't come back
Can you afford to lose me?
