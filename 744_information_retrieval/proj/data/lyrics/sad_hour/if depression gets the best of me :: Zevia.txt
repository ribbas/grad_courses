Empty and numb
Still can't get past all the sadness and the crumbs I left
Help me, I'm scared
'Cause the one thing on my mind is for me to disappear

So, mama, when I die
Please hold in your cry
Just know that when I'm gone
I'll always be right by your side
And, lover, when I leave
I know that we don't speak
I'm sorry that I failed you
But you meant the world to me

I lost my sight
I still can't see all the places where there might be light
I used to stare
At the mirror, now I don't 'cause when I do I see a ghost

It's not my fault that you feel like I'm so self-centered
I'm tryna be better, but I feel under the weather

So, mama, when I die
Please hold in your cry
Just know that when I'm gone
I'll always be right by your side
And, lover, when I leave
I know that we don't speak
I'm sorry that I failed you
You deserve better than me

(So, mama, when I die)
"Hi mom, it's me" (Please hold in your cry)
"I just wanted to call and say I love you" (Just know that when I'm gone)
"And I know that that's random" (I'll always be right by your side)
"But I feel like I don't say it enough, so here I am" (And, lover, when I leave)
"And I hope you are okay" (I know that we don't speak)
"Um, yeah, I love you, mom" (I'm sorry that I failed you)
"Okay, bye-bye" (You deserve better than me)
