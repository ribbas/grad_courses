Didn't wanna ask our friend if you were gonna be here and make the whole thing weird
But I was nervous in the car just in case you are, just in case the coast ain't clear
And I'm looking over people's shoulders
And that's fucked up, I know that
And I just had this vision of you looking at me different when you saw this dress
But I'd have one drink and I'd say the wrong thing, so it's probably for the best
And I'm looking over peoples shoulders
And I'm hoping that you're somewhere close

Everyone at this party isn't you
Everyone at this party isn't you
You're the only one I wanna run into
But I never do
Everyone at this party isn't you
Everyone at this party isn't you
I don't wanna search for you in every room
But I always do

I got in last night, staying on the west side
Scotty told me you're here
And I keep having these thoughts
Did we fuck it up or not?
Did we waste two years?
And did you get the space you needed?
Did you realize you don't need me?
Hey, did you realize you don't need me?

Everyone at this party isn't you
Everyone at this party isn't you
You're the only one I wanna run into
But I never do
Everyone at this party isn't you
Everyone at this party isn't you
Don't wanna search for you in every room
But I always do

Everyone at this party isn't you
Everyone at this party isn't you
Hey, did you realize you don't need me?
