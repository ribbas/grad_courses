Cheap marijuana
You smoke when you wanna
I don't wanna hit it
Pretend that I'm faded
You get what you want
Turn on the TV
Act like you don't see me
Max out the volume
I don't wanna bore you
But I'm losing my mind

Fuck my life
It was always yours
You were never mine
So fuck my life
I don't have the choice
So you decide

Do I save all the memories
Your clothes in the closet
Or pick up the pieces
And tape up the boxes
And fuck my life
I always yours
You were never mine

Two cups of coffee
Pretend that you're with me
I'll roll up your favorite
I used to hate it
Now I can't put it down
I'll throw on a movie
And sit where we'd usually
The scene you would stop it
Feels wrong to watch it
But look at me now

Fuck my life
It was always yours
You were never mine
So fuck my life
I don't have the choice
So you decide

Do I save all the memories
Your clothes in the closet
Or pick up the pieces
And tape up the boxes
And fuck my life

It always yours
You were never mine
You were never mine
So nevermind

Fuck my life
It was always yours
You were never mine
So fuck my life
I don't have the choice
So you decide

Do I save all the memories
Your clothes in the closet
Or pick up the pieces
And tape up the boxes
And fuck my life
I was always yours
You were never mine
