Oh, that's how I end up again
Whenever I think I find love again
There it goes
It's a shame that you and that heart of yours
Took your time, build it all up
And just let it fade

Darling, I've been waiting so long
Just to hear you say you're coming home
When you're not here this bed gets so cold
So let me fall asleep before you go

When I close my eyes
Please don't say goodbye, just say goodnight
'Cause we know goodbye's the end

What's the use in crying these tears again?
You don't mind letting me drown in them
Like a fool
It's a shame that you and that heart of yours
Took your time, build it all up
And just let it fade

Darling, I've been waiting so long
Just to hear you say you're coming home
When you're not here this bed gets so cold
So let me fall asleep before you go

When I close my eyes
Please don't say goodbye, just say goodnight
'Cause we know goodbye's the end

(Please don't say goodbye, just say goodnight)

When I close my eyes
Please don't say goodbye, just say goodnight
'Cause we know goodbye's the end
