I keep the letters that you wrote
In a secret place
Every now and then I go
Down memory lane
October passed me by
Just like any month
But I still think of the times
You took the breath out of my lungs
You don't have to run

Yeah, I got bitter when you got cold
Could you really blame me though
'Cause I'm still tied up when you go
You know this song is about you
Who else could it be?
You were the first to make me
Feel like I was me
Just a memory

It wasn't all good, yeah
It wasn't all pretty
Lost our grip
While tryna go steady
Holding on to you like maybe
One day we'll meet

I met you at the wrong time
Didn't wanna see
I was busy with the stars
You were looking at me
For better or for worse
I don't know
But for what it's worth
I made you my whole world
I made you my whole world

Screaming at the top of my lungs, "I love you my girl"
Always in the back of my mind
You'll be my girl
