I think I wanna text you
But I don't know what I would say
We didn't leave it on the best note
But I don't wanna be afraid
Remember talking after midnight?
Remember trying to stay awake?
Remember feeling just a little bit less alone on the next day?

'Cause I do
I, aye
Every second with you running circles in my brain
I do
I, aye
Do you remember all the plans we made?
I do

I think I wanna call you
I wonder if you'd call me back
'Cause I can hear it when you're smiling
And I can feel it when you're mad
Remember talking 'bout our exes?
Remember laughing through the pain?
Remember feeling just a little bit less alone on the next day?

'Cause I do
I, aye
Every second with you running circles in my brain
I do
I, aye
Do you remember all the plans we made?
I do

Up late for no damn reason
I always end up thinking
You're still the only person that's living rent free inside my head
Don't know if I'm still healing
But I wonder what you're feeling
And if you had a reason would you wanna see me?

'Cause I would
I would

'Cause I do
I, aye
Every second with you running circles in my brain
I do
I, aye
Do you remember all the plans we made?
I do

I do, I
I do, I

'Cause I do
I, aye
Do you remember all the plans we made?
I do
