Can we go back to eighteen
When all that we had was daydreams
When you were my everything
We were falling for each other
Remember in the summer

Driving around, you're not around these days
Same paper town feels different now and I hate
Seeing you in every face
It's a memory that I can't shake
Where are you now and did you get out this place

Can we go back to eighteen
When all that we had was daydreams
When you were my everything
We were falling for each other
Remember in the summer of 2013
Kissing in your backseat
Listening to the A-Team
I should've loved you better
But nothing lasts forever

Driving around, the city is loud these days
This Hollywood town is bringing me down
And I've changed
And you can see it on my face
It's a feeling that I just can't shake
Yeah, I don't know how, I gotta get out this place

And oh, it's just a dream I know

Can we go back to eighteen
When all that we had was daydreams
When you were my everything
We were falling for each other
Remember in the summer of 2013
Kissing in your backseat
Listening to the A-Team
I should've loved you better
But nothing lasts forever

Oh, it's just a dream I know
It's just a dream I know
It's a dream
It's just a dream
It's just a dream

Oh, it's just a dream I know
It's just a dream I know
It's a dream
It's just a dream
It's just a dream
