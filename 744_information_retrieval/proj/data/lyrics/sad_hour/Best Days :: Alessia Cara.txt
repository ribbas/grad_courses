So much harder to be honest
With yourself at twenty something
Wish I knew what I'm becoming
And felt the ground
While I was on it
Hoping
Waiting on a moment
Not knowing if it's coming or it's going

What if my best days are the days I've left behind?
And what if the rest stays the same for all my life?
I'm running with my eyes closed, so it goes
You live and then you die
But the hardest pill to swallow is the meantime
Are the best days just the ones that we survive?

If I'd known to fuel the fire
I would've thrown my arms up higher
Would've held on a little tighter
'Cause you don't know a thing you'll miss 'til it's behind you

What if my best days are the days I've left behind?
And what if the rest stays the same for all my life?
I'm running with my eyes closed, so it goes
You live and then you die
But the hardest pill to swallow is the meantime
Are the best days just the ones that we survive?

What if my best days are the days I've left behind?
And what if the rest stays the same for all my life?
What if the best days are the days I've left behind?
And what if the rest stays the same for all my life?
