I'll give you whatever I can
But honestly there's not a lot where I stand
And nobody knows where we'll go
But I've got a hunch that it feels like home
And nobody knows you like I do

So take me down to earth
I'll listen to everything you say
If nothing else gets you through, gets you through
Then, darling, I'll cry with you, cry with you

And even though you hurt
I'm always a phone call away
As long as I'm here with you, here with you
Then, darling, I'll cry with you, cry with you
(Cry with you)

It's been a while since you said
"If I don't get famous, I'm better off dead"
So please stick around for a while
'Cause there's a whole lot that'll make you smile
And nobody knows you like I do
And nobody cares like we do

So take me down to earth
I'll listen to everything you say
If nothing else gets you through, gets you through
Then, darling, I'll cry with you, cry with you

And even though you hurt
I'm always a phone call away
As long as I'm here with you, here with you
Then, darling, I'll cry with you, cry with you
Cry with you

I can't get it out of my head
Life's a bitch, pretty soon we'll be dead
I'm dissociating right now
Take my hand and we'll figure it out
Can't find the meaning, I can't find a reason
It hurts just to say it out loud
(It hurts just to say it out loud)
And nothing's forever
I hope you get better
I'll make it up to you somehow

So take me down to earth
I'll listen to everything you say
If nothing else gets you through, gets you through
Then, darling, I'll cry with you, cry with you

And even though you hurt
I'm always a phone call away
As long as I'm here with you, here with you
Then, darling, I'll cry with you, cry with you
Cry with you
