Like the weather in September I am constantly changing
Every minute my emotions turn I feel like a stranger, in my own skin
Oh, I know it can be difficult to keep up with all my feelings
Wouldn't blame you if you wanna leave I burn all my bridges, like I always do

I don't want you to go, but I can't make you stay

If you want sun, I'll pour like rain
Autumn in summer
The bluest sky can feel so grey
I know I
I can be hard to love, hard to love, hard to love
When it's easier to just give up
I can be hard to love, hard to love, hard to love
When it's easier to just give up

Can you see me changing color like the leaves in October?
Feel the water pouring down it's putting weight on my shoulders, is it over?
Oh, I know the world is difficult, gave us more than we could handle
Now every time I'm feeling down it's getting harder to call you, so I don't call

I don't want you to go, but I'm falling away

If you want sun, I'll pour like rain
Autumn in summer
The bluest sky can feel so grey
I know I
I can be hard to love, hard to love, hard to love
When it's easier to just give up
I can be hard to love, hard to love, hard to love
When it's easier to just give up

Giving way too much is not enough running round in a circle
Chasing something
Knowing every touch leaves a scar would you say that it's worth it?

If you want sun, I'll pour like rain
Autumn in summer
The bluest sky can feel so grey
I know I
I can be hard to love, hard to love, hard to love
When it's easier to just give up
I can be hard to love, hard to love, hard to love
When it's easier to just give up
