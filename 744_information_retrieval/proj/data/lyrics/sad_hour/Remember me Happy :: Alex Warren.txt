I don't wanna live no more
I'm a stranger in my body
I don't recognize the person I've become
And what am I doing this for?
I wanna say I'm sorry to the people that I love
Forgive me for leaving
I never meant to keep this all from you

Sometimes I wonder would you visit when I'm gone
Put petals on my stone
Remember me happy
Or not even at all
These thoughts are monsters in my head
It's a battle I won't win
This can't go on forever
Here's hoping it gets better

Something really needs to change
Yeah I may have lost my family
But I found myself a new one along the way
And I know have a tendency
To let my demons get the best of me
Oh, the ones I won't let you see
Oh

Sometimes I wonder would you visit when I'm gone
Put petals on my stone
Remember me happy
Or not even at all
These thoughts are monsters in my head
It's a battle I won't win
This can't go on forever
Here's hoping it gets better

Oh-oh
There's so much you can't see
Oh-oh
You brought out the best in me
Oh-oh
You'll be looking down on me
Down on me
Oh, oh

These thoughts are monsters in my head
It's a battle I won't win
This can't go on forever
Here's holding on together
