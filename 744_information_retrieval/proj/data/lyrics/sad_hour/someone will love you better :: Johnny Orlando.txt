(Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ah)

The greatest romance, lightning strike to my heart
We would slow dance in my headlights in the parking lot
There was no chance of ever falling apart
But you've noticed that I'm here but I'm so far

'Cause I've been running from the sun
And I got nowhere left to hide

Every night I close my eyes
And wish I was still in love
Trying to fight the war with my mind
It's gonna kill me to give you up
Darling, this is gonna hurt
No, I won't regret it
'Cause I loved you first
But someone will love you better

Last time I'll hold you just 'cause you need it
Hard to console you when I can't give you reasons
Hate that love can be a thing you lose
There's nothing you or I could do
We were fools to fall
And it's nobody's fault, no

'Cause I've been running from the sun
And I got nowhere left to hide (Hide)

Every night I close my eyes
And wish I was still in love
Trying to fight the war with my mind
It's gonna kill me to give you up
Darling, this is gonna hurt
No, I won't regret it
'Cause I loved you first
But someone will love you better

(Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ah)
'Cause I loved you first
But someone will love you better
(Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ah)
'Cause I loved you first
But someone will love you better

Darling, this is gonna hurt
I won't regret it
'Cause I loved you first
But someone will love you better
