We were one part drama we were two parts friend
We were tied by trauma from the day we met
And everybody knows that I'm a wreck
Guess getting rid of me is common sense

I try my best
To push it down
It's pouring out again
Again

I spill my guts like a drink cause I have to
Write your name on a wall in the bathroom
Here I go venting to strangers

I fill the void with a boy in the backseat
Over share through the glass in the taxi
Here I go venting to strangers (to strangers)

I wish I was someone other than me
Like the boy who bags your groceries
Yeah, we're both strangers him and me
But at least he has something you need

I spill my guts like a drink cause I have to
Write your name on a wall in the bathroom
Here I go venting to strangers

I fill the void with a boy in the backseat
Over share through the glass in the taxi
Here I go venting to strangers (to strangers)

(To strangers, to strangers... ooohh)

I try my best
To push it down
It's pouring out again
Again
