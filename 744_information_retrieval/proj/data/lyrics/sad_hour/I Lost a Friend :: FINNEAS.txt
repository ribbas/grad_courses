I lost a friend
Like keys in a sofa
Like a wallet in the backseat
Like ice in the summer heat

I lost a friend
Like sleep on a red-eye
Like money on a bad bet
Like time worrying about every bad thing that hasn't happened yet

I know I'll be alright
But I'm not tonight
I'll be lying awake counting all the mistakes I've made
Replaying fights
I know I'll be alright
But I'm not tonight

I lost a friend
I lost a friend
I lost my mind
And nobody believes me
Say, "I know that he don't need me,
'Cause he made a little too much money to be twenty and sad."
And I'll be fine without him
But all I do is write about 'em
How the hell did I lose a friend I never had?
Never had

I'm on the mend
Like I'm wearing a neck brace
Like I'm sleeping in my own place
Like I'm pulling all the stitches out of my own face

I'm on the mend
Like I'm icing a new sprain
Like I'm walking on a new cane
Like it's been a couple days since I slipped and said something sorta like your name

I know I'll be alright
But I'm not tonight
I'll be lying awake counting all the mistakes I've made
Replaying fights
I know I'll be alright
But I'm not tonight

I'm on the mend
But I lost a friend
I lost my mind
And nobody believes me
Say, "I know that he don't need me,
'Cause he made a little too much money to be twenty and sad."
And I'll be fine without him
But all I do is write about 'em
How the hell did I lose a friend I never had?

I'd apologize 
If I thought it might 
Make a difference 
Or make you listen
I'd apologize 
If it was black and white
But life is different
Just try to listen 
To me now

I know I'll be alright
But I'm not tonight
I lost a friend
I lost a friend
I lost my mind
And nobody believes me
Say, "I know that he don't need me,
'Cause he made a little too much money to be twenty and sad."
And I'll be fine without him
But all I do is write about 'em
How the hell did I lose a friend I never had?

Never had
