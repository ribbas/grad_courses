We've been swingin' and missin'
It ain't broke yet, but damn, it needs fixin'
Been a while since your kiss felt like kissin'
It's just different

We've been talkin' 'bout forever since we been together
Somethin' 'bout a ring makes you think we're better
Off with all this, but we're caught in-between

A rock and a hard place
Red wine and mistakes
Tears rollin' down your face
When I walked out that door
That's when I lost it
Midnight in Austin
Damn, I'm exhausted
What the hell's this all for?
Is this where it mends or it breaks?
Between a rock and a hard place

For the record (Shit)
Throwin' in the towel takes some effort
So I'd rather ride it out for better weather
Together

Between a rock and a hard place
Red wine and mistakes
Tears rollin' down your face
When I walked out that door
That's when I lost it
Midnight in Austin
Damn, I'm exhausted
What the hell's this all for?
Is this where it mends or it breaks?
Between a rock and a hard place

We've been talkin' 'bout forever since we been together
Somethin' 'bout a ring makes you think we're better
Off with all this, but we're caught in-between

A rock and a hard place
Tears rollin' down your face
As I walked out that door
That's when I lost it
Midnight in Austin
Damn, I'm exhausted
What the hell's this all for?
Is this where it mends or it breaks?
How much more of this can we take?
