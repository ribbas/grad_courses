I wait for the morning tide
The ocean's to rise
But I lay here broken
Too heavy to float
I'm an emotionless wreck

So I tell myself this lie
I'm not scared to die
Make molehills of mountains
There's gold in this ground
But I ain't found it yet

So I leave before you go
'Cause there's no tears when it's my fault
This self-sabotage
All of our other scars don't compare

Take the river to the sea
Drown myself so I don't sink
Find my peace there underneath
The hurricane

Break a promise so I can leave
Burn a forest so I can sleep
Lay my headstone
Let the grass grow over me

There's nothing to fill this void
Stuck turning the soil
So I lay here soaking
There's sand in my bed
What a day to regret

So I leave before you go
'Cause there's no tears when it's my fault
This self-sabotage
All of our other scars don't compare

Take the river to the sea
Drown myself so I don't sink
Find my peace there underneath
The hurricane

Break a promise so I can leave
Burn a forest so I can sleep
Lay my headstone
Let the grass grow over me

We didn't make a difference
And we thought we were different
Oh, oh, oh
