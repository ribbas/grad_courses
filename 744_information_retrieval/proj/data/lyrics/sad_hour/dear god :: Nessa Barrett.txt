Dear God
Do you hear me when I'm crying, when I doubt?
And my soul is worth saving, thinkin'
"I'm not good enough for you to answer, what the fuck?"
Don't you love us all the same?

I've taken more than my share of pain
Can't you hear me you say your name?
Can't you see I've got these

Angel wings
Sewed on to my back with black ribbon
I know you know it hurts my skin
I was just trying to get into heaven
I've been dying to fit in

Dear God
If I drown myself deep in this holy water
Will it wash away my sins?
I thought you could help me make myself feel better, daughter
But it hasn't happened yet

I've taken more than my share of pain
Can't you hear me you say your name?
Can't you see I've got these

Angel wings
Sewed on to my back with black ribbon
I know you know it hurts my skin
I was just trying to get into heaven
I've been dying to fit in

Mmm-mmm (Dear God)
Mmm-mmm-mmm
Mmm-mmm (Dear God)
Mmm-mmm-mmm
Don't you hear me when I cry?
