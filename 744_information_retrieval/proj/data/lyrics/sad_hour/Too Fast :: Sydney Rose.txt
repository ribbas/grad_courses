I'm driving twenty-five, going too fast
I'm driving twenty-five, trying not to crash
I can see the look in your eye
I can see you're terrified
This kinda thing doesn't last
I think I'm going too fast

You got it good baby, good baby
But what you're seeing isn't really that good maybe
I'll never see you again
If it's not now then when?
This kinda thing doesn't last
I think I'm going too fast

Dropped her off at the apartment
Now I can't see the pavement
I've always been a stranger to change now
He's got me tied up in chains
It's been a week since I've been out
I haven't really been around
Haven't been the same since I broke down
I'm more alone than ever now

Haven't been the same since seventeen
At one time I had everything in front of me
I think I'm going too fast
This kinda thing doesn't last
I think I'm going too fast
This kinda thing doesn't last

I've had enough of people in this town
I've had enough of not making a sound
Wasting away while they went around
All I did was just try to figure it out
I'm driving twenty-five, going too fast
I'm driving twenty-five, trying not to crash

Haven't been the same since seventeen
At one time I had everything in front of me
I think I'm going too fast
This kinda thing doesn't last
I think I'm going too fast
This kinda thing doesn't last
I think I'm going too fast
I think I'm finally gonna crash
I think I'm going too fast
This kinda thing doesn't last
This kinda thing doesn't last
