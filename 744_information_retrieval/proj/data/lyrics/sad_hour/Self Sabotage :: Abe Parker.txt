There's a voice saying I'm a failure if I quit
It's the same one saying that I can't make it
And I wanna scream but I live in an apartment
Where the carpet smells and all the walls are paper-thin
They said we could be anything in 7th grade
I guess I was dumb enough to believe what they said
And now I'm just another dreamer that LA tore apart

How do you get out of your head?
Telling yourself you won't make it
And second nature is to second guess, or when you
Burn every bridge before you cross
Wave a white flag before you lost
How do you not self-sabotage?

I miss weddings and funerals, and honest I
Don't know how to answer when my Mom asks why
I'm still trying to tell myself that I'm not wasting a life
And I push away love when I need it
Write these songs and then delete it
Stay awake all night wondering why
(Still wondering why)

How do you get out of your head?
Telling yourself you won't make it
And second nature is to second guess, or when you
Burn every bridge before you cross
Wave a white flag before you lost
How do you not self-sabotage?

I don't need a backseat driver
Trying to give myself some grace
Been living with myself full time and
I'm finally trying to see things face to face

How do you get out of your head?
Telling yourself you won't make it
And second nature is to second guess
You burn every bridge before you cross
Wave a white flag before you lost
How do you not self-sabotage? Oh

The only one in my way is me
How do I learn to set me free?
How do you not self-sabotage?
