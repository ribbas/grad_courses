(Street sounds swirling through my mind
Street sounds swirling through my mind)

I can get down, I can get lonely
Every time I think about the highs, yeah
Messed me around and now you keep callin'
Wonderin' if you can make it right

I told you it's the end for you and I
Swear this time we're through, but it's a lie
When you call my name, yeah, ooh, yeah
It sounds so right, so right, so right

Deep down, wishing you were mine
Deep down, miss you all the time
Dream 'bout what we could've been if we tried
Oh, but deep down, wishing you were mine, were mine

Deep down, you got me so
Deep down, I wanna go
Deep down, you got me so, yeah
Deep down, you got me so
Deep down, I wanna go
Deep down, you got me so, yeah

Yeah

Need to be strong
As soon as I see ya, you can turn my tables back around
So easy
You got the control
Just hearin' you speak just gets me kinda crazy
Kinda foolish, foolish, yeah

I told you it's the end for you and I
Swear this time we're through, but it's a lie
When you call my name, yeah, ooh, yeah
It sounds so right, so right, so right

Deep down, wishing you were mine
Deep down, miss you all the time
Dream 'bout what we could've been if we tried
Oh, but deep down, wishing you were mine, were mine

Deep down, miss you all the time
Dream 'bout what we could've been if we tried
Oh, 'cause deep down, wishing you were mine, were mine

Deep down, you got me so

Deep down, wishing you were mine
Deep down, miss you all the time
Dream 'bout what we could've been if we tried
Oh, but deep down, wishing you were mine, were mine

(Street sounds swirling through my mind) You got me so
(Street sounds swirling through my mind) I wanna go
(Street sounds swirling through my mind) You got me so
(Street sounds swirling through my mind)
