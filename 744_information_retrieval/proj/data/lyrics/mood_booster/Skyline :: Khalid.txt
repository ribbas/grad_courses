It's a Wednesday night
And we're running out of time
Won't you take my hand
Hop into my skyline
It's only just a rebuild
But I swear it feels real
When you take my hand
In my passenger side

All lights (All on you)
City lights (Fall on you)
Such a beautiful world
We're so high (I'm with you)
Hypnotized (I'm with you)
Such a beautiful world

It's like I'm living my dream out
Dream out
Yeah
Feels like we're on LSD
All day out
Yeah

It's a Wednesday night
And we're running out of time
Won't you take my hand
Hop into my skyline
It's only just a rebuild
But I swear it feels real
When you take my hand
In my passenger side

It's a Wednesday night
And we're running out of time
Won't you take my hand
Hop into my skyline
It's only just a rebuild
But I swear it feels real
When you take my hand
In my passenger side

Leave it all
In our rear view
As we pass the finish line
(It's just us)
Yeah, it's you and I
Racing under the green light
(Feel the rush)
Intensify
Lately I feel so alive
Such a beautiful world

It's like I'm living my dream out
Dream out
Yeah
Feels like we're on LSD
All day out
Yeah

It's a Wednesday night
And we're running out of time
Won't you take my hand
Hop into my skyline
It's only just a rebuild
But I swear it feels real
When you take my hand
In my passenger side

It's a Wednesday night
And we're running out of time
Won't you take my hand
Hop into my skyline (Into my skyline)
It's only just a rebuild
But I swear it feels real
When you-

Yeah
(Take my hand)
(Take my hand)
(Take my hand)
(Take my hand)
