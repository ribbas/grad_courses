Got no connection, no faith or direction, no
Searching and searching for someone to save my soul (Ooh)

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
I was wept up in a wave, swept up in a wave
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Then I heard you say my name
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah

Lost, I was lost, I was lost 'til you loved me
Now I'm found, now I'm found, now I'm found
Yeah, you took me to the place, it was safe, it was sound (Sound, sound, sound)
Lost, I was lost, now I'm found
Lost, I was lost, I was lost 'til you loved me
Now I'm found, now I'm found, now I'm found
Yeah, you took me to the place, it was safe, it was sound (Sound, sound, sound)
Lost, I was lost, now I'm found

I was so broken, my heart was an empty space (Oh, oh, oh)
Life was a joke 'til the moment I saw your face, saw your face, saw your face

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
I was wept up in a wave, swept up in a wave
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Then I heard you say my name
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah

Lost, I was lost, I was lost 'til you loved me
Now I'm found, now I'm found, now I'm found
Yeah, you took me to the place, it was safe, it was sound (Sound, sound, sound)
Lost, I was lost, now I'm found
Lost, I was lost, I was lost 'til you loved me
Now I'm found, now I'm found, now I'm found
Yeah, you took me to the place, it was safe, it was sound (Sound, sound, sound)
Lost, I was lost, now I'm found

Ooh, ooh, ooh, again (Again)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, again, yeah (Again)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, again (Again)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, again, yeah (Again)

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
I was wept up in a wave, swept up in a wave
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah

Lost, I was lost, I was lost 'til you loved me (I was lost, lost)
Now I'm found, now I'm found, now I'm found (Now I'm found, found, found)
Yeah, you took me to the place, it was safe, it was sound (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Lost, I was lost, now I'm found (Oh yeah)
Lost, I was lost, I was lost 'til you loved me (I was lost, lost)
Now I'm found, now I'm found, now I'm found (Now I'm found, found, found)
