Let's go to hell together
We can burn forever
I got nothing better to do
You know that I'm not a rebel
I just know the devil
Can't be much worse than me and you

Let's let this mothafucka burn to the ground
I lost the love that I thought I found
Took all the money out my account
I bought an 8th, then I bought a pound
Smoke it up til I can't hear sounds
Flip the Earth and turn it upside down
Come on baby, go south bound

There's a secret place in Arizona
You can never see it if you're sober
Opens up into a supernova
Yah

It will never drop one degree colder
Feel the flames, with heat burning your shoulders
You'll be fine when this thang's all over

Let's go to hell together
We can burn forever
I got nothing better to do
You know that I'm not a rebel
I just know the devil
Can't be much worse than me and you

Let's go to hell together
We can go whenever
Hold me down cause we're going fast
I'll be your one ride or die-r
Through the smoke and fire
Love the good times, they never last

The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
Let that mothafucka burn down (burn it down)
Now you, and you, do whatchu gotta go
But we gone dance like we in downtown

Move it, move it now to the music
This fever dreaming so lucid
Your life is super confusing
Baby it's hard to be human
Yah

Running red like we ain't wreckin
No seat belt we aint checkin
Baby you think this is heaven

Let's go to hell together
We can burn forever
I got nothing better to do
You know that I'm not a rebel
I just know the devil
Can't be much worse than me and you

Let's go to hell together
We can go whenever
Hold me down cause we're going fast
I'll be your one ride or die-r
Through the smoke and fire
Love the good times, they never last

Oh-ooh, they never last, they never last
