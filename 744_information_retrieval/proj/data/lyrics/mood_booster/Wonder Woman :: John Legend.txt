Hmm
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Hmm-hmm

When I'm lost, when I'm low
How do you always know?
Oh, you're right there to save me
At the end of my road
When I'm floatin' in space
How do you stay in place?
When the whole word has caven
Oh, you're my saving' grace

You make me wonder woman
How do you do it?
Some superpower
I don't understand
You make me wonder woman
How do you do it?
You're superhuman
And I'm just a man

You're the best at my worst
More than what I deserve
Always right there beside me
Could have put yourself first
Give me hope, give me help
When I'm goin' through hell
Showed me lovin' somebody
Starts with lovin' myself

You make me wonder woman
How do you do it?
Some superpower
I don't understand
You make me wonder woman
How do you do it?
You're superhuman
And I'm just a man

Woah, nah-nah-nah, nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah-nah, nah-nah
Nah-nah-nah, nah-nah, ooh
Nah-nah, nah
Woo-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Yeah

You make me wonder woman
How do you do it?
Some superpower
I don't understand
You're superhuman
And I'm just a man
