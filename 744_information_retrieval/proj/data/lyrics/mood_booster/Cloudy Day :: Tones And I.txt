Am I living?
Oh, what a funny thing to say
But there's alive and then there's living
Am I living for today?
And I'm getting older
With every memory I make
Now that I'm older with these moments will I live for them or just throw them away, away?

But your mumma always said look up into the sky, find the sun on a cloudy day
But your mumma always said look up into the sky, find the sun on a cloudy day
On a cloudy day

But your mumma always said look up into the sky, find the sun on a cloudy day
(On a cloudy day)
But your mumma always said look up into the sky, find the sun on a cloudy day
(On a cloudy day)

And am I wiser
For holding close the friends I make?
But if I'm wise then why this feeling
Of a child that I can't shake?
And I'm getting older
With every memory I make
Now that I'm older with these moments will I live for them or just throw them away, away?

But your mumma always said look up into the sky, find the sun on a cloudy day
But your mumma always said look up into the sky, find the sun on a cloudy day
On a cloudy day

But your mumma always said look up into the sky, find the sun on a cloudy day
(On a cloudy day)
But your mumma always said look up into the sky, find the sun on a cloudy day
But your mumma always said look up into the sky, find the sun on a cloudy day

But your mumma always said look up into the sky, find the sun on a cloudy day
(On a cloudy day)
But your mumma always said look up into the sky, find the sun on a cloudy day
But your mumma always said look up into the sky, find the sun on a cloudy day
Day, day, day

Oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
On a cloudy day
