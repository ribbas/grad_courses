I could have my Gucci on
I could wear my Louis Vuitton
But even with nothin' on
Bet I made you look (I made you look)

I'll make you double take soon as I walk away
Call up your chiropractor just in case your neck break
Ooh, tell me what you, what you
What you gon' do, ooh
'Cause I'm 'bout to make a scene, double up that sunscreen
I'm 'bout to turn the heat up, gonna make your glasses steam
Ooh, tell me what you, what you
What you gon' do, ooh

When I do my walk, walk (Oh)
I can guarantee your jaw will drop, drop (Oh)
'Cause they don't make a lot of what I got, got (Ah, ah)
Ladies if you feel me, this your bop, bop (Bop-bop-bop)

I could have my Gucci on (Gucci on)
I could wear my Louis Vuitton
But even with nothin' on
Bet I made you look (I made you look)
Yeah, I look good in my Versace dress (Take it off)
But I'm hotter when my morning hair's a mess
'Cause even with my hoodie on
Bet I made you look (I made you look)
Mhm-hm-hm

And once you get a taste (Woo), you'll never be the same
This ain't that ordinary, it's that 14 karat cake
Ooh, tell me what you, what you
What you gon' do, ooh

When I do my walk, walk (Oh)
I can guarantee your jaw will drop, drop (Oh)
'Cause they don't make a lot of what I got, got (Ah, ah)
Ladies if you feel me, this your bop, bop (Bop-bop-bop)

Ooh, I could have my Gucci on (Gucci on)
I could wear my Louis Vuitton
But even with nothin' on
Bet I made you look (Said I made you look)
Yeah, I look good in my Versace dress (Take it off, baby)
But I'm hotter when my morning hair's a mess (A mess)
'Cause even with my hoodie on
Bet I made you look (Said I made you look)
