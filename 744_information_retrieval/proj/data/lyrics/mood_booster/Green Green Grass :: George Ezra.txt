Well she moves like lightning
And she counts to three
Then she turns out all the lights
And says she's coming for me
Now put your hands up
This is a heist
And there's no one in here living
Gonna make it out alive

Load it up when the sun comes down
Getaway car for two young lovers
Me and the girl straight out of town
Over the hills and undercover
Undercover, undercover
She said

Green green grass, blue blue sky
You better throw a party on the day that I die
Green green grass, blue blue sky
You better throw a party on the day that I die

We go together, Adam and Eve
But the girl is so much more than just another apple thief
Yeah, she's a genius (genius), watch and learn
How she sets the world on fire just to watch the sucker burn

Load it up when the sun comes down
Getaway car for two young lovers
Me and the girl straight out of town
Over the hills and undercover
Undercover, undercover
She said

Green green grass, blue blue sky
You better throw a party on the day that I die
Green green grass, blue blue sky
You better throw a party on the day that I die

Throw a party (yeah), throw a party yeah
Throw a party (woo), on the day that I die
Throw a party (hey), throw a party yeah
Throw a party, on the day that I die

Load it up when the sun comes down
Getaway car for two young lovers
Me and the girl straight out of town
Over the hills and undercover
Undercover, undercover
She said

Green green grass, blue blue sky
You better throw a party on the day that I die
Green green grass, blue blue sky
You better throw a party on the day that I die
Green green grass, blue blue sky
You better throw a party on the day that I die
Green green grass, blue blue sky
You better throw a party on the day that I die
