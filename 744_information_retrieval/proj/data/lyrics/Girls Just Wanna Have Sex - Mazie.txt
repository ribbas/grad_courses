Eden is a hedonist
She listens to the smiths
I'm more like a one night stand apologist
She's so out of my league
Every time I swing I miss
But oh my god, I think we're
Oh my god, we're gonna kiss

Her hands are on my neck she's got a grip
She can turn me on just like a switch
It really gets me goin' when she tells me just like this

Get outta your head
Tell your man to drop dead
Get into my bed
Girls just wanna have sex

Get outta your head
Tell your man to drop dead
Get into my bed
Girls just wanna have
Girls just wanna have
Girls just wanna have sex

Oh, fuck she's eating me out
I'm trying not to scream on her parents' couch
I don't even know what we were talkin' about
But we were messin around
And then it happened so quick

Her hands are on my neck she's got a grip
She can turn me on just like a switch
Really gets me goin' when she tells me just like this

Get outta your head
Tell your man to drop dead
Get into my bed
Girls just wanna have sex

Get outta your head
Tell your man to drop dead
Get into my bed
Girls just wanna have
Girls just wanna have
Girls just wanna have sex
