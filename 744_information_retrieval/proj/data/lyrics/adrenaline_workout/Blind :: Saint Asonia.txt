Would you believe me, the things that I say
I'm tired, I'm gone, I'm lost without you
You don't see through me you can't run away
I'm changing, deranging

The darkness replacing composure
It burns my eyes
As I watch the flame die

I will be satisfied
When I get to the finish line
And take back all that's mine
The fire in me hasn't died
Always trying to put it out
You made it so bright, now you're blind

So easy to see you and me today
A searchlight were alright were fine without this
Self loathing fear now that stands in our way
I'm fading, degrading

The darkness replacing composure
It burns my eyes
As I watch the flame die

I will be satisfied
When I get to the finish line
And take back all that's mine
The fire in me hasn't died
Always trying to put it out
You made it so bright, now you're blind

My fire burns for the broken ones
The unspoken ones
My fire burns down the battered halls
And the bleeding walls
We find our way to climb
Over the barricade and masquerade
We light our fire and burn
