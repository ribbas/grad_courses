It's always Southern California in my head
Where summer never ends (Summer never ends)

Wherever I go, you come with me
I think of you and it puts me at ease
Sun on my face and the sand on my feet
There is no other place I'd rather be
So, I'm gone but soon I'll be home
The road is calling me
Another show, another song left to sing so
So, it might be a while 'til I'll see you, Cali

It's always Southern California in my head
Where summer never ends, summer never ends
It's always Southern California in my head
Where summer never ends, summer never ends

High daydreams, I ignite a match up
Smilin', laughin', coolin' out, relaxin'
From sunrise to sunset we dancin'
Waves crash, waters splash, summer vibes reaction
We walk the shore forever
I don't think it ever ends
Nowhere better so these thoughts I remember
I'm confined to my mind till I see you again

It's always Southern California in my head
Where summer never ends, summer never ends
It's always Southern California in my head
Where summer never ends, summer never ends

C-A-L-I am always goin' back
C-A-L-I am always goin' back
C-A-L-I am always goin' back
C-A-L-I am always goin' back

It's always Southern California in my head
Where summer never ends

It's always Southern California in my head
Where summer never ends, summer never ends
It's always Southern California in my head
Where summer never ends, summer never ends

It's always (It's always)
California (California)
It's always (It's always)
California (It's always California)
