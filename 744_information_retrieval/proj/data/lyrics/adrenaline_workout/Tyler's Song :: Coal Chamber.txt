Go son. 
If you get up but they slap you around. 
Then just remember that i will always be there.
When I say to you daddy love you understand. 
I'm out in the real world again I'm trying.
Raise your gaurd again. 
They dont't give a damn. 
Don't compormise your ideals for anyone else.
Respect your mom and always think of her first.
When I say to you daddy loves you understand. 
I'm out in the real world again I'm trying.
Raise your gaurd again. 
They dont't give a damn. 
Son, if the son don't shine. 
I'll try like hell to make light fromt he dark.
Son if the sun dont shine. 
I'll try like hell to make light from the dark for you.
Raise your gaurd again. 
They don't give a damn. 
Go son.
