Step away
From all my hateful feelings for this world
I fall into myself again
Holding out
For something I could never have
I've fallen from your grace again

My god, I feel so low
I just needed something new
I find myself with you
I find myself in you
Waiting for the long way back home
Way back home

Ready to die!
Ready to die!

Take my pain
Wont let you slap me in the face again
This time I'm bleeding from my eyes
This should not have come as a surprise
I'm waiting and ready to die

Look away
I'll find out who you answer to tonight
I'm breaking down in pain again
Losing out
I never tried to walk away
I've fallen out of place again

My god, I feel so low
Am I finally breaking through
Breaking through to you
Breaking through and

Ready to die!
Ready to die!

Take my hate
You wont be questioning my faith again
This time I'll leave it all behind
Now you've got me choking on your lies
I'm waiting and ready to die

Phycho, let go
Ready to die!
Phycho, let go
Ready to die!

Take my pain
Wont let you slap me in the face again
This time I'm bleeding from my eyes
This should not have come as a surprise
I'm waiting and ready to die

Ready to die!
Ready to die!
Ready to die!
