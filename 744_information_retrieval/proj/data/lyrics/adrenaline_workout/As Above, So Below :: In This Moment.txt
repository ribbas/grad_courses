I won't lie - it's quite tempting
Your handouts and your bones
I won't lie - they're quite empty
Your promises and your stones

If you sell they'll buy
Don't feel - just sign
If you sell they'll buy
Don't think - stay blind

Give me the control
Sign on the dotted line
Give me the control
She whispered softly

Give me the control
You're crawling inside my mind
Give me the control
Don't you fight me

As above, so below
What you reap is what you sow
What you give comes back three fold
As above, so below

Watch me, watch me float away
I was never yours to save
It all comes back three fold
As above, so below, so below

(As above-bove, as above)
(As above-bove, as above)

See I've danced with the enemy
We have secrets no one knows
Yeah I've danced with my enemy
I wore her skin and her clothes

If I sell you'll buy
Just feel - just sign
If I sell you'll buy
Just think - you're mine

Give me the control
Just sign on the dotted line
Give me the control
She whispered softly

Give me the control
You're crawling inside my mind
Give me the control
Don't you fight me

As above, so below
What you reap is what you sow
What you give comes back three fold
As above, so below

Watch me, watch me float away
I was never yours to save
It all comes back three fold
As above, so below, so below

(So below, so below)
(So below, so below)

As above-bove, as above
(As above-bove)
As above-bove, as above
(-bove, -bove, so below)
As above-bove, as above
(As above-bove)
As above-bove, as above
(-bove, -bove, so below)

As above, so below
What you reap is what you sow
What you give comes back three fold
As above, so below

Watch me, watch me float away
I was never yours to save
It all comes back three fold
As above, so below, so below
