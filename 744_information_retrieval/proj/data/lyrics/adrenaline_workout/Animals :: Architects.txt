I do my best, but everything seems ominous
Not feeling blessed, quite the opposite
This shouldn't feel so monotonous
It never rains, but it pours

We're just a bunch of fucking animals
But we're afraid of the outcome
Don't cry to me because the fiction that we're living in
Says I should pull the pin

Should I just pull the pin?
Should I just pull the pin?

I dug my heels, I thought that I could stop the rot
The ground gave way, now I've lost the plot
Fucked it again, that was all I've got
It never rains, but it pours

Life is just a dream within a...

We're just a bunch of fucking animals
But we're afraid of the outcome
Don't cry to me because the fiction that we're living in
Says I should pull the pin

Buried under dirt, a diamond in the mud
Infinity is waiting there 'cause nobody can burn a glass cathedral

Dream within a, dream within a...

We're just a bunch of fucking animals
But we're afraid of the outcome
Don't cry to me because the fiction that we're living in
Says I should pull the pin
We're just a bunch of fucking animals
But we're afraid of the outcome
Don't cry to me because the fiction that we're living in
Says I should pull the pin

Should I just pull the pin?
Should I just pull the pin?
(Buried under dirt, a diamond in the mud)
Should I just pull the pin?
(Infinity is waiting there 'cause nobody can burn a glass cathedral)
Should I just pull the pin?
