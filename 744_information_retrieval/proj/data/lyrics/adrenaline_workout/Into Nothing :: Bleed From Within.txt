Prepare for the fall out
Like it's the end of days
Unless we turn the page
We'll be alone again
Aggressors connected
The cracks expose the weak
Blood boils in the mouth
For only iron speaks

What you sow, you will reap
Now hear the cries as the martyrs weep

This is not a war, it's a victory
I've looked into the eyes of misery
Cover up the truth spread hypocrisy
From nothing you came
And into nothing you'll return

The ashes of ambition
Scatterings of grey fall away
Dance through the dusk and into day
These puppets cry misery
Then slowly decay
This is not a war, it's a victory

What you sow, you will reap
Now hear the cries as the martyrs weep

Into nothing
A desperate plea for change
Into nothing
With jaded eyes we gaze, upon the end of days

This is not a war, it's a victory
I've looked into the eyes of misery
Cover up the truth spread hypocrisy
From nothing you came
And into nothing you'll return

These cycles are repeating
It's left a sickening taste
Despite the consequence, we show no fear, go!

We are the curse that spreads
Through the depths of the earth, let chaos ascend
Behold salvation as it's stripped away from you!
We've thrown ourselves into the void
Set free to end the pain
They're praying the blood will wash up in the rain
Wash up in the rain!

From nothing you came
And into nothing you'll return

This is not a war, it's a victory...
Cover up the truth spread hypocrisy...
