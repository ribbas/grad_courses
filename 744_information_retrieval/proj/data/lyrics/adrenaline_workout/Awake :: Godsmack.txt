Wait another minute. Can't you see what this pain has fucking done to me.
I'm alive and still kickin'. What you see I can't see and maybe
you'll think before you speak.

I'm alive, for you I'm awake. Because of you.
I'm alive. Told you I'm awake. Swallowing you

Take another second. Turn your back on me and make believe that
you're always happy.
It's safe to say you're never alive. A big part of you has died
and by the way, I hope you're satisfied.

[Chorus]

Tearing it back unveiling me.
Taking a step back so I can breathe.
Hear the silence about to break.
Fear resistance when I'm awake.
