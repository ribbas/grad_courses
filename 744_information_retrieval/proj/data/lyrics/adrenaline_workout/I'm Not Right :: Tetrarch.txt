Looking in the mirror and I hate myself
Looking in the mirror and I hate myself
Looking in the mirror and I hate myself
Looking in the mirror and I

I've gotta get this off my chest
I don't know what to do
I'm stuck in motion, nothing's working
I'm coming unglued
Wish I could push it all away
I just wanna get away (To get away from here)

I can be strong, other times I cry
I close my eyes, try to clear my mind
Something's missing, I'm not right
My reflection lies to me, I've lost myself

This time I'm serious, things cannot stay the same
Whenever I try to end this cycle, I lose all hope
But this is nothing new (Get up)
I can't seem to catch a break with anything (Quit bitching)
There's no path for me to take (To get away from here)

I can be strong, other times I cry
I close my eyes, try to clear my mind
Something's missing, I'm not right
My reflection lies to me, I've lost myself

I'm not right
I'm not right

Look in the mirror and I hate myself
Look in the mirror and I hate myself (I'm not right)
Look in the mirror and I hate myself
Look in the mirror and I hate myself (I'm not right)
Look in the mirror and I hate myself
Look in the mirror and I hate myself (I'm not right)
Look in the mirror and I hate myself
Look in the mirror and look in the mirror and

Hate, hate
I'm done with everything
Hate, hate
I'm done with everything
I close my eyes
Look in the mirror and
Hate, hate
I'm done with everything
I close my eyes
Nothing left inside

I can be strong, other times I cry
I close my eyes, try to clear my mind
Something's missing, I'm not right
My reflection lies to me
I can be strong, other times I cry
I close my eyes, try to clear my mind
Something's missing, I'm not right
My reflection lies to me, I've lost myself
I've lost myself

Hate
I'm done with everything
Hate
I'm done with everything
