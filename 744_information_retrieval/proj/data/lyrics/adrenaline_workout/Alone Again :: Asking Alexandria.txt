Bring me hope
Take me home
I think I'm ready to be on my own
Close my eyes
Lay me down
I think it's time that I take some time
To be alone again

I've waited, been patient
Dedicated in the name of
Being more, giving all, that I have, but you want more
I've changed and I'm changing
It's not over there's still time left
It isn't much, so make the most, I'm getting tired, of giving up

Searching for silence

Bring me hope
Take me home
I think I'm ready to be on my own
Close my eyes
Lay me down
I think it's time that I take some time
To be alone again

I can't find my balance
I've been trying so hard but
What I love, you seem to hate, and what I hate, you seem to love
I'm lost, It's confusing
What point am I proving?
I don't know anymore what to do or who to be

Bring me hope
Take me home
I think I'm ready to be on my own
Close my eyes
Lay me down
I think it's time that I take some time
To be alone again

Bring me hope
Take me home
I think I'm ready to be on my own

Bring me hope
Take me home
I think I'm ready to be on my own
Close my eyes
Lay me down
I think it's time that I take some time
To be alone again
I think it's time that I take some time
To be alone again
