You suffer from a manufactured sickness and envy by design
Pre-calculated status and patterns of desire
Accumulation and adoration, built to feed your ostentation
Perpetually unsatisfied, but you never question why

So hang it on the wall of your golden cage
Tell yourself that it means something

Empty actions to fill the time
Commercial gods keep you in line
Industry and empire thrive
While you're dying for always more

Your endless hunger automated, industry defined
A systematic impulse, parametric lines
Subjugation and degradation the blueprint to your annihilation
Your assets personified, a product of the times

So hang a mirror on the wall of your golden cage
Tell yourself that you mean something

Empty actions to fill the time
Commercial gods keep you in line
Industry and empire thrive
While you're dying for always more

So you can't take it with you but you don't use it now
A shallow life to crush you, drive you into the ground
So scared to lose the nothings you acquire
Everything must fall, bones on a pyre

(So scared to lose it all
So scared to lose it all)
Always more
Always more
More and more and more

Empty actions to fill the time
Commercial gods keep you in line
Industry and empire thrive
While you're dying for always more
Always more
