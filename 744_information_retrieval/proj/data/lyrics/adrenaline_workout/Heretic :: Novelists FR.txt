I just want to forget, to purify my veins, and all my body's affected
Would you give me a break cause I can see no regret, I know you're gonna infest it
Oh, break the fiction and now I know, glare the fire inside my eyes
I don't think that I can cope with this anymore

So when you're trying to tear the world apart
A place you never belonged
And though you're tired of running in the dark
Just know you'll never be done
Fire, set me on fire
Fire, set me on fire
So when you're trying to tear the world apart
Fire, set me on fire

So you wanna go places, hiding your face from me
I don't wanna pretend, everything's what it seems
Heaven knows when you pray (I don't wanna know)
The feeling of pure disdain (makes me wanna go)
Hiding won't numb the pain (you better lay low)
You'll wanna let go of us

I don't need another voice or medication
And I'm sick of all the causes and the gods you cherish

There is no one up above
There is no one up above

I'm just sick of all the causes and the gods you pray
Pray your lord while you're wasting away

(So when you're trying to tear the world apart)

And in all the torment
I won't let go
Every time I'm nervous
I can't lay low (I feel alive)
When the time comes (it will arrive)
Don't let me go (just set the fire)
Just set me on (set me on fire)

So when you're trying to tear the world apart (tear the world apart)
A place you never belonged
And though you're tired of running in the dark (running in the dark)
Just know you'll never be done
Fire, set me on fire (And in all the torment, I won't let go)
Fire, set me on fire (Every time I'm nervous, I can't lay low)
So when you're trying to tear the world apart
Fire, set me on fire
