Old familiar face
That bitter taste
She's been hangin' round too long
That crooked tongue
So pale, so young
Makes me warm

Take me to the darkness
Hang me out to dry
Tangled in your legs
In the webs of your lies
Lead me to the rapture
Set my body free
Higher than the flames
Set blaze inside of me
Whoa

There's no turning back
There's no coming down
I'm forever lost
There's no coming down

Oh, I'm skin and bones
Pale as a ghost
Well I know that I should be moving on
But in your embrace
You know I'll never change
Hopeless I am chained down on my knees

Take me to the darkness
Hang me out to dry
Tangled in your legs
In the webs of your lies
Lead me to the rapture
Set my body free
Higher than the flames
Set blaze inside of me

There's no turning back
There's no coming down
I'm forever lost
There's no coming down

When you call my name
I'm never far away
When you call my name
I know there's no escape

Take me to the darkness
Hang me out to dry
Tangled in your legs
In the webs of your lies
Lead me to the rapture
Set my body free
Higher than the flames
Set blaze inside of me
Whoa

There's no turning back
There's no coming down
I'm forever lost
There's no coming down
