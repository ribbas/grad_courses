Oh God who lives in hell
How glad I am to see you
You covet the acid from collected tears
Make me believe that I don't need you
Hiding the broken legs
Heroic vocation

If left to die you'd eat your young
It won't be easy to believe
I'm sure you've been taken advantage of
Advantage of
Advantage of
Advantage

Blood cover won't steal my name
And now you won't ever hold it again

Give your love to no one
If you can't control them
Looking at me
Doesn't matter
Listen to me
You might find your answer

No detection but the mark has been made
They are all your children
Now they all grow stronger

Broken in two
Divided attention
I won't give health
To feed your addiction

You won't get help
You feed your addiction
You feed your addiction
Too late to find any way to go on
