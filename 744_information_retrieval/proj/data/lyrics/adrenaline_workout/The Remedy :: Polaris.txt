Heavy hangs the air
Heavy lies the beating heart

Bloodshot, staring with a blank gaze
Deadbeat, carrying a dead weight
Dead-set on living like tomorrow was to blame
And through these holes you'd see the blackest soul inside of me
One foot stuck in the past, one planted in my grave

Running circles, old habits die hard
Each lesson learned never seemed to get too far
Call me reckless, call me stuck in my ways
I'm torn between the remedies for everything

Bloodshot, staring with a blank gaze
Deadbeat, carrying a dead weight
Dry mouth, taste it like a cut vein
Blackout, it all ends the same

So stay away, stay away
Can you tell when I lie right through my teeth?
No escape, no escape
Like a chain, in a way we are all bound to our fate

Don't let it bury me, me
We call this therapy

Running circles, old habits die hard
Each lesson learned never seemed to get too far
Call me reckless, call me stuck in my ways
I'm torn between the remedies for everything

Heavy hangs the air
Heavy lies the beating heart
Burden breeds remorse
Black clouds hover low like a curse

Running circles, old habits die hard
Each lesson learned never seemed to get too far
Call me reckless, call me stuck in my ways
I'm torn between the remedies for everything
