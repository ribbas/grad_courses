Secrets whispered through a veil of lies
When did I become this person you despise?

Open my eyes
You've been in disguise
The door is closing
You're on the outside now
It's curtain call

After everything I did for you
This is what you choose to put me through?
What happened to the concept of loyalty?
I guess there really is no more honesty!

Open my eyes
You've been in disguise
The door is closing
You're on the outside now
It's curtain
It's curtain call

Deceiver, deceiver
My head still spinning from your Judas kiss
Deceiver, deceiver
Not one thing about you I will miss

You put on a great act, I'll give you that
Go on and take a bow you despicable rat
Accept the applause, you king of whores
This is your grand finale

Deceiver, deceiver
My head still spinning from your Judas kiss
Imposter, I see you
Thou beest slain, tyrant, show thy face!

Open my eyes
You've been in disguise
The door is closing
You're on the outside now
It's curtain call
It's curtain call

Deceiver, deceiver
I see... you!
