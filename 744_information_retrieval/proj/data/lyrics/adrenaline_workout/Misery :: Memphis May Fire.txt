I feel it coming like it's looking for some violence
Try to speak but it's saying to be silent
I grab the bottle hoping I can make it quiet
But they get louder every time I try to hide it

Nothing left to lose at rock bottom
Wounds turned to scars yeah, I got 'em
But I've come to learn you gotta let it burn
If you're gonna be forged in the fire

I try to take the pain away
And nothing seems to change
But when I go through hell
That's when I know myself
And all the lies that I believe
Are diggin' me a grave
But when I go through hell
That's where I find myself
Remade in misery

I found myself in the dark with blurry vision
The walls turned to bars, it was a prison
Could have found my way out if I'd have listened
I had to die to find what I'd been missing

Nothing left to lose at rock bottom
Wounds turned to scars yeah, I got 'em
And I've come to learn you gotta let it burn
If you're gonna be forged in the fire

I tried to take the pain away
But it kept chasing me
It's never gonna leave

I try to take the pain away
And nothing seems to change
But when I go through hell
That's when I know myself
And all the lies that I believe
Are diggin' me a grave
But when I go through hell
That's where I find myself
Remade in misery

It's easier to say I hate it
Than to admit that I create it
I'm done running, I'm done running
I'm done running, I can't escape it

It's easier to say I hate it
Than to admit that I create it
I'm done running, I'm done running
I'm done running, I can't escape it

I try to take the pain away
And nothing seems to change
But when I go through hell
That's when I know myself
And all the lies that I believe
Are diggin' me a grave
But when I go through hell
That's where I find myself
Remade in misery

Remade in misery
