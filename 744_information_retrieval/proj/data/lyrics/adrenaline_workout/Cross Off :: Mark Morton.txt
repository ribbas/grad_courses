Cross off the days gone
Cross off the days gone
Gone by

Wasting away
A self-inflicted slow decay
What should've been, what never was
Became the end for both of us

Heavy is the hand that points the finger (Finger)
Heavy is the heart that's filled with anger (Anger)
So lay them all to waste
Years you decided to erase
And cross off the days

So black out and hide behind the lines
Keep staring down the sun and hope the
Light will finally blind your eyes from seeing
Cross off the days gone by
Cross off the days gone by
Cross off the days gone by

Cutting you free
The phantom limb was part of me
You have lived, you have lost
The separation's worth the cost

Heavy are the words that go unspoken (Spoken)
Heavy are the promises now broken (Broken)
Will you learn to love the taste
Of the destruction in your wake?
Cross off the days

So black out and hide behind the lines
Keep staring down the sun and hope the
Light will finally blind your eyes from seeing
Cross off the days gone by
Cross off the days gone by
Cross off the days gone

Gone by
Making my way back from the madness
Shifting my thoughts from the blackness
And the sadness, but the fact is
I'm swinging through life like a clenched fist
Fuck sanity, I wanna bleed
Can't kill the pain, it's everything
It's all I feel
It's what I breathe
Turn the hate I breed into what I need
Heavy is the hand that points the finger (Finger)
Heavy is the heart that's filled with anger (Anger)

Did you survey everything you laid to waste
And cross off the days?

So black out and hide behind the lines
Keep staring down the sun and hope the
Light will finally blind your eyes from seeing
Cross off the days gone by
Cross off the days gone by
Cross off the days gone by
