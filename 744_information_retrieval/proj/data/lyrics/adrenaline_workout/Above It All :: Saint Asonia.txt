It's time to take a stand and save our lives

I'm sick of burying all my feelings
In isolation
I'm done with absorbing all the beatings
Where's the salvation?

We've been drowning for far too long

It's time to take a stand and save our lives
Rise before we fall
There's no more second chance it's do or die
Rise above it all

I've felt the wearying sense of failure
Corroboration
I've traded everything with a traitor
Dissociation

It's time to take a stand and save our lives
Rise before we fall
There's no more second chance it's do or die
Rise above it all

It's time to take a stand and save our lives
Rise before we fall
There's no more second chance it's do or die
Rise above it all

It's time to take a stand and save our lives
Save our souls
There's no more second chance it's do or die
Rise above it all

It's time to take a stand and save our lives
Rise before we fall
There's no more second chance it's do or die
Rise above it all
