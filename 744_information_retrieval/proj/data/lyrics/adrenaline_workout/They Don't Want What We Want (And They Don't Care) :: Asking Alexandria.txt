Can you feel the hairs stand on the back of your neck?
Can you feel your heart beating right out of your chest?

Panic

There's something strange going on in this room
The walls are melting I can hear the ceiling screaming to come down
I can't believe we built this room
It was meant to be a sanctuary, not a prison

There's something strange going on in this house
It's like we're pushing all these buttons tryna start a war
Amongst ourselves, but we don't know what we want
All we know's that we don't want what they want

(Hey, hey) What we want
(Hey, hey) What we want
(Hey, hey) What we want
(Hey, hey) What we want

Can you feel the hairs stand on the back of your neck?
Can you feel your heart beating right out of your chest?
Can you feel your bones ache like there's something within?
Can you feel your blood pumping inside of your skin?

Can you feel it?
Panic panic
Panic panic
Can you feel it?
Panic panic
Panic panic

There's something wrong with the castle they're in
Watching over every single move that we make
Try to see past their perfect smiles
They were supposed to be protectors not o-fucking-ppressors 

There's something wrong with the way that they speak
Like the more they take from us the better off that we'll be
Anything to get the power they seek
All I know's that they don't want what we want

(Hey, hey) What we want
(Hey, hey) What we want
(Hey, hey) What we want
(Hey, hey) What we want

Can you feel the hairs stand on the back of your neck?
Can you feel your heart beating right out of your chest?
Can you feel your bones ache like there's something within?
Can you feel your blood pumping inside of your skin?

Can you feel it?
Panic panic
Panic panic
Can you feel it?
Panic panic
Panic panic

We don't want what they want
They don't want what we want
We don't want what they want
And they don't care

Panic
