Mother-fuck the way you think
You never made sense anyway
Building up to tear it down
You're code-pendent on apathy
By design you fucking sterilize, so you desensitize
Make it easier to swallow
Self-involved you fucking took it all, who's gonna take the fall
Cause it's never gonna be the same
Change!

Don't wanna see, don't wanna think
Don't wanna speak for yourself
Don't wanna see, don't wanna think
Don't wanna speak for yourself

It's like a fucking disease
It's like a fucking disease
It's like a fucking disease
And it shows!
It's like a fucking disease
It's like a fucking disease
It's like a fucking disease
And it shows!

Repetition paves the way
All for you to weaken and sedate
So contrived and watered down
A fucking shadow of what should have been
Isolate so you can separate, and fucking terminate
To diffuse the situation
Force on me a common enemy, with no identity
Now it's showing your perception too
Change!

Don't wanna see, don't wanna think
Don't wanna speak for yourself
Don't wanna see, don't wanna think
Don't wanna speak for yourself

It's like a fucking disease
It's like a fucking disease
It's like a fucking disease
And it shows!
It's like a fucking disease
It's like a fucking disease
It's like a fucking disease
And it shows!

You will never see, you will never see
You will never see, you will never see
You will never see!

Don't wanna see, don't wanna see and it shows
Don't wanna think, don't wanna think and it shows

It's like a fucking disease
It's like a fucking disease
It's like a fucking disease
And it shows!
It's like a fucking disease
It's like a fucking disease
It's like a fucking disease
And it shows!

Don't wanna see, don't wanna think
Don't wanna speak for yourself
Don't wanna see, don't wanna think
Don't wanna speak for yourself

It's like a fucking disease
It's like a fucking disease
It's like a fucking disease
And it shows!
It's like a fucking disease
It's like a fucking disease
It's like a fucking disease
And it shows!
