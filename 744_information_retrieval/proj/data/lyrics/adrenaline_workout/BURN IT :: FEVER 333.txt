For all the homies doin' time, look alive
For every tear your mama cried, look alive
When the Five-O arrive, look alive
Everybody look alive, look alive

You ain't ready
Yeah

See we always on the run
'Cause they be chasing us for fun
When the neighborhood in pieces
They say to pray and look to Jesus
Light a candle with the sun
'Cause we lost another one
Got us pledging our allegiance
To a hand that doesn't feed us, preach

I got a mouth like Malcolm
And hands is like Ali
Black panther, white mother
You better not try me
I got a mind like Martin
Visions of Rodney King
My city's on fire

You know sometimes you gotta burn it down
To build it up again
Lights go out in the town we're living in
Burn it down when no one's innocent
Burn it down

I am a god on the run
I am a god on the run
I am a god on the run

Now we live behind the lines
That they be keeping us inside
And if red denotes the devil
Then in hell is where we'll settle
If I had to pick a side
It's Inglewood until I die
We the necessary evil
For all these fake angelic people

I got a mouth like Malcolm
And hands is like Ali
Black panther, white mother
You better not try me
I got a mind like Martin
Visions of Rodney King
My city's on fire

You know sometimes you gotta burn it down
To build it up again
Lights go out in the town we're living in
Burn it down when no one's innocent
Burn it down
I am a god on the run

(Fight for survival but we was dead on arrival)
(So we gon' fight for survival until we win)
Put me in front of the gun
(Fight for survival but we was dead on arrival)
(So we gon' fight for survival until we win)
Put me in front of the gun
Put me in front of the gun

You know sometimes you gotta burn it down
To build it up again
Lights go out in the town we're living in
Burn it down when no one's innocent
Burn it down

We point our fingers while they point their guns
Bullets, they miss us, we're gods on the run
So burn it down and build it up again
Burn it down

I am a god on the run
I am a god on the run
I am a god on the run
