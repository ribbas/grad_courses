It was a fun, strange summer
I rolled on, didn't think of you
We lost touch with each other
Fall came and I had to move

Moving backwards, hurt comes after
Healing doesn't happen in a straight line

If I cry just a little
And then laugh in the middle
If I hate you then I love you
Then I change my mind
If I need just a little
More time to deal with the fact
That you should have treated me right
Then I'm more than just a little justified
I'm more than just a little justified

To touch somebody
You know I tried to make that you
And when you lied and said, you didn't want me
Tell me what was I supposed to do?

Moving on was feeling strong
But healing doesn't happen in a straight line

If I cry just a little
And then laugh in the middle
If I hate you and I love you
Then I change my mind
If I need just a little
More time to deal with the fact
That you should have treated me right
Then I'm more than just a little justified
I'm more than just a little justified

If I die just a little
Inside just a little
If I want you and I call you
Then I change my mind
If I need just a little
More time to deal with the fact
That I should have treated you right
I'm more than just a little

If I cry just a little
And then laugh in the middle
If I hate you and I love you
Then I change my mind (A million times)
If I need just a little
More time to deal with the fact
That you should have treated me right
Then I'm more than just a little justified
I'm more than just a little justified
