Easier said than done
Trying to be the one
It's so hard to not be hard on yourself
How do they all believe?
I cannot even see
The belief that I had way back when

I know that you get so used to it
Always living in regret
Your dreams never left your head
But when you talk to me
I can see the light shining
So bright that it is blinding
Just let it out oh

Oh, I know you feel it
That automatic shiver in your spine 
(That automatic shiver in your spine)
Darkness, you have seen it (Seen it)
Heavy on the heart, look to the light

Oh, release the feeling ah
It'll send you out to space
Nothing like your happiness 
(Nothing like it)
Oh, open up the ceiling
You think you don't deserve it
But you are so damn worth it, baby

You think you don't deserve it
But you are so damn worth it, baby
You think you don't deserve it
But you are so damn worth it, baby

We've all got that feeling
I can see you hurting
You don't think you deserve it
But, baby, you are worth it
Just open up the ceiling
Come on, let the love in
'Cause, baby, you are worth it

We've all got that feeling
I can see you hurting
You don't think you deserve it
But, baby, you are worth it
Just open up the ceiling
Come on, let the love in
'Cause, baby, you are worth it

Oh, I know you feel it
That automatic shiver in your spine
Uh
Darkness, you have seen it
Heavy on the heart, look to the light, yeah

Oh, release the feeling ah
It'll send you out to space
Nothing like your happiness
Oh, open up the ceiling
You think you don't deserve it
But you are so damn worth it, baby

We've all got that feeling
I can see you hurting 
(You think you don't deserve it)
You don't think you deserve it 
(But you are so damn worth it, baby)
But, baby, you are worth it
Just open up the ceiling (Uh, ay)
Come on, let the love in 
(You think you don't deserve it)
'Cause, baby, you are worth it 
(But you are so damn worth it, baby)

We've all got that feeling (Ooh)
I can see you hurting (Baby)
You don't think you deserve it
But, baby, you are worth it
Just open up the ceiling (Come on, let it)
Come on, let the love in
'Cause, baby, you are worth it 
(You are so damn worth it, baby)
