Everybody's after me again
Go and tell em they can catch me if they can
If they ain't tryna be a friend
Then I don't need them
You can catch me on the beach
Got sun on me and got sand up on my feet
They won't ever get no drama outta me

There's something about myself, I like
It wasn't just overnight
To love yourself takes some time
To love myself took some time and now
I'm great, I'm fine
If you ask me I'm doing killer
I see myself a little clearer
Lately I've been dancing in the mirror
Ooooh, ooooh
Lately I've been dancing in the mirror
Ooooh, ooooh

Everybody hatin' on the net
I won't take no disrespect
Go and give it all a rest
Cause I don't need them
Turn my cheek and look away
Then I sip my lemonade
That's a game that I don't play

There's something about myself, I like
It wasn't just overnight
To love yourself takes some time
To love myself took some time and now
I'm great, I'm fine
If you ask me I'm doing killer
I see myself a little clearer
Lately I've been dancing in the mirror
Ooooh, ooooh
Lately I've been dancing in the mirror
Ooooh, ooooh

Ooo yeah I love myself
I like the way I feel, I feel
Ooo yeah I love myself
I like the way I feel

Everybody hatin' on the net
I won't take no disrespect
Go and give it all a rest

There's something about myself, I like
It wasn't just overnight
To love yourself takes some time
To love myself took some time and now
I'm great, I'm fine
If you ask me I'm doing killer
I see myself a little clearer
Lately I've been dancing in the mirror
Ooooh, ooooh
Lately I've been dancing in the mirror
Ooooh, ooooh
Lately I've been dancing in the mirror
