Stop using your words as weapons

I swear this town's a battlefield
Can make you feel strong and vulnerable
These empty hearts are made of steel
But underneath they're not invincible
We're nothing but some stardust and molecules
Trying to find the light in the darkest rooms
So no matter what you say to me, oh

I got a bulletproof vest under my dress
Packed bags under my bed
The biggest hearts are the biggest targets
It's the hardest, oh

Stop using your words as weapons
They're never gonna shoot me down
Stop, it's time that you learn a lesson
My love is gonna drown you out
Do you wanna fight, do you wanna dance?
'Cause tonight might be the only chance, so
Stop using your words as weapons

Don't see the blood, don't see the tears
You only taste what I put on my feet
You see the smoke before it clears
So let me show you what's underneath

I got a bulletproof vest under my dress
Packed bags under my bed
The biggest hearts are the biggest targets
It's the hardest, oh

Stop using your words as weapons
They're never gonna shoot me down
Stop, it's time that you learn a lesson
My love is gonna drown you out
Do you wanna fight, do you wanna dance?
'Cause tonight might be the only chance, so
Stop using your words as weapons

Shoot me down, shoot me down, baby, baby
Another round, 'nother round, baby, baby
Shoot me down, shoot me down, baby, baby
One more time for the hell of it

Stop using your words as weapons
They're never gonna shoot me down
Stop it's time that you learn a lesson
My love is gonna drown you out
Do you wanna fight, do you wanna dance?
'Cause tonight might be the only chance, so
Stop using your words as weapons
