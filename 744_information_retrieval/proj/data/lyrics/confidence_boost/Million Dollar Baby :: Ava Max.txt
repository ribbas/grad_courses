She's a miracle

Diamonds
She turns tears to diamonds, woah
Trying to find that silver lining, woah
And once in a while

I'll go walkin' in the twilight
Counting down to midnight
Close my eyes and wait for her to shine
I'm hiding in the shadows
Praying that she'll break free

In the dark of the night
She got danger on her mind
She's a million dollar baby
Nobody can explain it
She's a miracle
She's a miracle, oh, oh, oh, ooh

She broke out of her chains
Turned the fire into rain
She's a million dollar baby
She's bound to drive you crazy
She's a miracle
She's a miracle, oh, oh, oh, ooh

Heart broke, oh
You can't keep her down though, oh
Ah, ah, ice cold
Just coming back to life now, woah

And one in a while
I'll go walkin' in the twilight
Counting down to midnight
Close my eyes and wait for her to shine
I'm hiding in the shadows
Praying that she'll break free

In the dark of the night
She got danger on her mind
She's a million dollar baby
Nobody can explain it
She's a miracle
She's a miracle, oh, oh, oh, ooh

She broke out of her chains
Turned the fire into rain
She's a million dollar baby
She's bound to drive you crazy
She's a miracle
She's a miracle, oh, oh, oh, ooh

Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, miracle
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, miracle
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma
She's a miracle, oh, oh, oh
In the dark of the night
She got danger on her mind
She's a million dollar baby
Nobody can explain it
She's a miracle

She broke out of her chains
Turned the fire into rain
She's a million dollar baby
She's bound to drive you crazy
She's a miracle
She's a miracle, yeah, yeah
She's a miracle, woah

Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, miracle
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, miracle (Woah)
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma
She's a miracle, oh, oh, oh
