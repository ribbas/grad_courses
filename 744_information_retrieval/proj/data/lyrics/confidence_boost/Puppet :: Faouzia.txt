Goodbye to the one that I once knew
I could never change just to love you
Looked me in my face, said I was insane
Playing all your little games, games, games
Oh, tried to dim my flame. I shine brighter
And you tried to dull my blade. Keep trying
And you tried to pull me under
You said I was too much. You're just not enough

I was born to dance, dance
Could never tie strings to my hands, hands
You could only love a pu- pu- puppet
I could never be a pu- pu- puppet
I was born to dance, dance
Could never tie strings to my hands, hands
You could only love a pu- pu- puppet
I could never be a pu- pu- puppet

Hello to the one that I am now
Guess it didn't go how you planned out
Little did you know, I'm my own Geppetto
And now you get to watch me go, go, go

Tried to dim my flame. I shine brighter
And you tried to dull my blade. Well keep trying
And you tried to pull me under
You said I was too much. You're just not enough

I was born to dance, dance
Could never tie strings to my hands, hands
You could only love a pu- pu- puppet
I could never be a pu- pu- puppet
I was born to dance, dance
Could never tie strings to my hands, hands
You could only love a pu- pu- puppet
I could never be a pu- pu- puppet
Love!

I was born to dance, dance
Could never tie strings to my hands, hands
You could only love a pu- pu- puppet
I could never be a pu- pu- puppet
Love!

Pu- pu- puppet
I could never be a pu- pu- puppet
No!
