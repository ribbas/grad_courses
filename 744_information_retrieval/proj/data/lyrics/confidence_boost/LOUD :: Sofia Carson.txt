Confrontation never has been my strength
Always felt like I should take all the blame
But something is changing
And I can't contain it no more, yeah
All the speeches that I've made in my head
All the "no"s I know that I should've said
Like waves in this water
We're rising up stronger, come on

If I was a man
Then you would understand
You wouldn't say I'm causing all this drama

Are you getting uncomfortable now?
I'm a little too loud for you now
Don't try to calm me down
I was made to be loud
Goodbye to living a lie
'Cause that got me nowhere in life
Don't try to calm me down
I was made to be loud, yeah

I don't care if you don't like what you see
I'm not pleasing you 'cause I'm pleasing me
Not wasting more time
I'ma speak up my mind when I want

If I was a man (Man)
Then you would understand ('Stand)
You wouldn't say I'm causing all this drama

Are you getting uncomfortable now?
I'm a little too loud for you now
Don't try to calm me down (Down)
I was made to be loud
Goodbye to living a lie
'Cause that got me nowhere in life
Don't try to calm (Calm) me (Me) down (Down)
I was made to (To) be (Be) loud (Loud), yeah

Ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh

Are you getting uncomfortable now?
I'm a little too loud for you now
Don't try to calm me down
I was made to be loud
Goodbye to living a lie
'Cause that got me nowhere in life
Don't try to calm (Calm) me (Me) down (Down)
I was made to (To) be (Be) loud (Loud), yeah

Ooh (Loud)
Ooh-ooh (Ah)
Ooh-ooh (Loud)
Ooh-ooh (Ooh-ooh)
