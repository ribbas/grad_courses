Girls, I got girls, only girls
Going wild in my mind
In my mind

That night when I saw you
I was about to leave
You were in the corner
Hanging like a masterpiece
You dancing with all your best friends
Or maybe you could spend the song with me
Had a tight t-shirt
I could see what's underneath
Talking over speakers
You're leaning close to me
You tuck my hair behind my ear
I put my finger through the loop of your jeans

I knew right then, right there it was so cinematic
Because it started to rain
And I said, "Oh my God, your body's speaking my language"
I told my mom it's not a phase 'cause

I kissed a girl and I liked it
Sipped her like an old fashion
I kissed a girl and she liked it
It's better than I imagined
The way she took my heart and my number
Don't think I'll recover
Till she's in my covers coming over tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
Yeah, I really, really liked it

Girls, I got girls, only girls
Going wild in my mind
In my mind

Wanna hold this moment
The way you're holding me
Swimming in your ocean
You move like poetry
She struck me hard like lightning
And I don't think I'll ever come back (And I don't think I'll ever come back)

I knew right then, right there it was super dramatic
Because it started to rain
And she said, "Oh my God, your body's speaking my language"
Go tell your mom it's not a phase 'cause

I kissed a girl and I liked it
Sipped her like an old fashion
I kissed a girl and she liked it
It's better than I imagined
The way she took my heart and my number
Don't think I'll recover
Till she's in my covers coming over tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
Yeah, I really, really liked it

Girls, I got girls, only girls
Going wild in my mind (In my mind)
In my mind (In my mind)
Girls, I got girls, only girls
Going wild in my mind (In my mind)
In my mind (In my mind)

I kissed a girl
No surprises
I really, really liked it
