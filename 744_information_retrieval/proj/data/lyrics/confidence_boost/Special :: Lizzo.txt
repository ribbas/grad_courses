Special

Woke up this morning to somebody in a video, talking
About something I posted in a video
If it wasn't me then would you even get offended or
Is it just because I'm Black and heavy?
Y'all don't hear me though

I've been the same since I've been driving slow on Bissonnet
Call up anybody I knew and they would tell you that
Fame is pretty new but I been used to people judging me
That's why I move the way I move and why I'm so in love with me

I'm used to feeling alone, oh
So, I thought that I'd let you know

In case nobody told you today
You're special
In case nobody made you believe
You're special
Well I will always love you the same
You're special
I'm so glad that you're still with us
Broken but damn, you're still perfect
Special

Could you imagine a world where everybody's the same
And you can cancel a girl 'cause she just wanted to change
How could you throw fucking stones, if you ain't been through her pain?
That's why we feel so alone, that's why we feel so ashamed

I'm used to feeling alone, oh
So, I thought that I'd let you know

In case nobody told you today
You're special
In case nobody made you believe
You're special
Well I will always love you the same
You're special
I'm so glad that you're still with us
Broken but damn, you're still perfect

I know that I'm not alone, oh
So, I thought that I'd let you know

In case nobody told you today
You're special
In case nobody made you believe
You're special
Well I will always love you the same
You're special
I'm so glad that you're still with us (I'm so glad)
Broken but damn, you're still perfect (So glad, so glad, so glad)
Special
You are, you are, you are so
