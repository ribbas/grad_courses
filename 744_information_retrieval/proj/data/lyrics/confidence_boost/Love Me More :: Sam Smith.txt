Have you ever felt like being somebody else?
Feeling like the mirror isn't good for your health
Every day I'm trying not to hate myself
But lately it's not hurting like it did before
Maybe I am learning how to love me more

It used to burn
Every insult, every word
But it helped me learn
Self-worth I had to earn
So I tried every night to sit with sorrow
And eventually it set me free

Have you ever felt like being somebody else?
Feeling like the mirror isn't good for your health
Every day I'm trying not to hate myself
But lately it's not hurting like it did before
Maybe I am learning how to love me more

Just a little bit (Love me more)
Just a little bit (Love me more)
Oh no (Love me more)
Just a little bit (Love me more)

I used to cry
Myself to sleep at night
I'd blame the sky
When the mess was in my mind
I couldn't see, I couldn't breathe
So I sat with sorrow
And eventually it set me free

Have you ever felt like being somebody else?
Feeling like the mirror isn't good for your health

Just a little bit (Love me more)

With a little bit of love (Love me more)
