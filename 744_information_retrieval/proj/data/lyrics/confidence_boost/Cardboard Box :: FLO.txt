I got a confession
I don't think I want you anymore
There's no room for questions
I saw her panties on the bathroom floor
Been putting up with this for far too long
You ain't got a chance boy
What's the point in stringing me along?
We're done for real

So I'ma put your shit in a cardboard box
Changing my number and I'm changing the locks
When you can't get in, oh, your heart gon' stop
You may be crying but boy, I'm not
I'ma put your shit in a cardboard box
Changing my number and I'm changing the locks
Never liked your momma so I guess she's blocked
You may be crying but boy, I'm not

Stressin', do you hear a stutter in my words?
I see it as a blessing
Come take your shit 'cause you can go stay at hers
I hope that she was worth my wasted time
But could she do it like I do?
You need someone to put you back in line
So you gon' see what I'll do

I'ma put your shit in a cardboard box
Changing my number and I'm changing the locks
When you can't get in, oh, your heart gon' stop
You may be crying but boy, I'm not
I'ma put your shit in a cardboard box
Changing my number and I'm changing the locks
Never liked your momma so I guess she's blocked (Oh)
You may be crying but boy, I'm not

So I'ma put your jeans next to the dreams that you sold me
Believe karma is a B and she gon' teach
Said I'ma put your gold chains down the drain, and your Roley
Might just drop a text to your homies

I'ma put your shit in a cardboard box
Changing my number and I'm changing the locks
When you can't get in, oh, your heart gon' stop
You may be crying but boy, I'm not
I'ma put your shit in a cardboard box
Changing my number and I'm changing the locks
Never liked your mamma so I guess she's blocked
You may be crying but boy, I'm not

Jeans next to the dreams that you sold me
Might just drop a text to your homie
You may be crying but boy, I'm not
