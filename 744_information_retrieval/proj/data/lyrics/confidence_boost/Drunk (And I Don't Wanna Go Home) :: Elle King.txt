I've got some money in my pocket
Got some trouble on my tail
I can hear the dives a-knocking
Guess I'm heading off the rails
Singing ooh ooh ooh ooh
I'm talking about you-ooh-ooh-ooh

I've got some new best friends forever
See, I met 'em at the bar
Well the whiskey goes down better
When they don't know who you are
Singing ooh ooh ooh ooh
I'm talking about you-ooh-ooh-ooh

Ooh gonna feel this in the morning
Ooh 'cause I'm going hard tonight

So bartender, take my keys
What do you want from me
Baby I'm drunk and I don't wanna go home
I'm not staying in to fight
I'm staying out all night
Baby I'm drunk and I don't wanna go home

We don't got to wait until the weekend
There's always time for jumping off the deep end
So don't you wait up tonight
Don't worry I'll be fine
Baby I'm drunk and I don't wanna go home

Yeah

We're in the bathroom getting chatty
There's a line out in the hall
Tryin'to be my Sugar Daddy
Getting' handsy in the stall
Singin'-ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
I'm talking about you-ooh ooh ooh

You like my gin n' tonic kisses
'Cause you know they taste so sweet
And I know you've got your missus
But there ain't no one like me

Talking about you-ooh ooh ooh
I'm talking about you-ooh ooh ooh

Ooh gonna feel this in the morning
Ooh 'cause I'm going hard tonight

So bartender, take my keys
What do you want from me
Baby I'm drunk and I don't wanna go home
I'mnot staying in to fight
I'm staying out all night
Baby I'm drunk and I don't wanna go home

We don't got to wait until the weekend
There's always time for jumping off the deep end
So don't you wait up tonight
Don't worry I'll be fine
Baby I'm drunk and I don't wanna go home

Well
I don't wanna
Don't wanna go home
I don't wanna

So bartender, take my keys
What do you want from me
Baby I'm drunk and I don't wanna go home
I'm not staying in to fight
I'm staying out all night
Baby I'm drunk and I don't wanna go home

We don't got to wait until the weekend
There's always time for jumping off the deep end
So don't you wait up tonight
Don't worry I'll be fine
Baby I'm drunk and I don't wanna go home

Well
Ooh
I don't wanna
Don't wanna go home
I don't wanna
Don't wanna go home
