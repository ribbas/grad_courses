When you first met me that girl wasn't me
She had my same blue eyes and my stupid big teeth
Oh, I know you miss the sad girl I was before
But I don't know who that is anymore

Me getting better, doesn't mean you're getting worse
It's just not how it works

You know I
I've been getting my steps in
You know I
I've been in therapy sessions
I've been working on me, but it ain't working on you
W-w-w-workin', w-workin' on you
It's true I
I've been on that motivation
Thanks to you, I had a new realization
I've been working on me, but it ain't working on you
W-w-w-workin', w-workin' on you

Why do I always gotta make the plans?
If I don't call you, I'm not sure if we'd still be friends
Well, you used to make me laugh 'til I would cry
Now the whole thing's sad, you can see it in your eyes

Me getting better, doesn't mean you're getting worse
No, It's just not how it works

You know I
I've been getting my steps in
You know I
I've been in therapy sessions
I've been working on me, but it ain't working on you
W-w-w-workin', w-workin' on you
It's true I
I've been on that motivation
Thanks to you, I had a new realization
I've been working on me, but it ain't working on you
W-w-w-workin', w-workin' on you

Me getting better, doesn't mean you're getting worse
Pretty please just quit the jealousy, and pull yourself together

You know I
I've been getting my steps in
You know I
I've been in therapy sessions
I've been working on me, but it ain't working on you
W-w-w-workin', w-workin' on you
It's true I
I've been on that motivation
Thanks to you, I had a new realization
I've been working on me, but it ain't working on you
W-w-w-workin', w-workin' on you
