Why is it so hard to just be myself
I feel like I'm different from everyone else
Yeah why am I like this, can somebody please tell me?
I look in the mirror and what do I see
I don't really know who's lookin' back at me
I don't even know who I wanna be

I don't need to know who I am yet
I don't need to have a solid plan yet
I don't need to be the same as everyone else
I just need to motherfuckin' love myself

I need to
I need to love myself
I need to
I need to love myself
I need to
I need to love myself
I need to love myself
Before I love anyone else

No matter how hard I try or what I do
I just can never fuckin' impress you
So why am I lettin' what you say get me down
I spent my whole life thinkin' I was wrong
And nobody likes me and it's all my fault
But I'm done with that shit, I've finally figured out

I don't need to be the same as everyone else
I just need to motherfuckin' love myself

I need to
I need to love myself
I need to
I need to love myself
I need to
I need to love myself
I need to love myself
Before I love anyone else

I need to
And I don't need your help
I need to (I need to)
Just fuckin' love myself
I need to
Before I love anyone else
I need to
Just fuckin' love myself
Oh no

Love myself
Love myself

People are constantly judgin' and eyein'
And plottin' and lyin', so why am I tryin'?
They're all gonna talk shit anyway
They're all gonna say what they wanna say
They're all gonna say what they wanna say
Anyway

That's why I need to...
I need to love myself
I need to, I need to
I need to love myself
I need to
I need to love myself
I need to love myself
Before I love anyone else

I need to
And I don't need your help
I need to (I need to)
Just fuckin' love myself
I need to
Before I love anyone else
I need to (I need to love myself yeah)
Just fuckin' love myself
Oh no
