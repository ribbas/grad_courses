Too thin, too small
One day, I'll fit in my jeans
Stretch marks, dark circles, under my eyes
But, no one wants to hear about that

I'm sick of putting labels on myself
Trying to fit in, trying to act like I'm somebody else
So I'm taking all this pressure off myself
I'm gonna say something for me, that's real

It's okay to be lost and feel lonely
Sometimes I just don't know what I'm doing
One day, I'm beautiful, then I'm ugly
But those days, they remind me that I'm human
So go ahead and rip, tear me apart
'Cause I'm not afraid of my flaws
If the scars on my skin make me ugly
Then let's get ugly
Let's get ugly

I know that they want, bright lights, highlights and contour on
Too scared, to be vulnerable
But when did we become afraid of that?

I'm tired of all the pretty little lies
Don't need a thousand likes
To know we're still beautiful inside
It's time to have the time of our lives
And say something real

It's okay to be lost and feel lonely
Sometimes I just don't know what I'm doing
One day I'm beautiful, then I'm ugly
But those days, they remind me that I'm human
So go ahead and rip, tear me apart
'Cause I'm not afraid of my flaws
If the scars on my skin make me ugly
Then let's get ugly
Let's get ugly

I'm a recipe for disaster
Or I could be the recipe for, the happiest ever after
I'm a recipe for disaster
I could be the recipe for, the happiest ever after

It's okay to be lost and feel lonely
Sometimes I just don't know what I'm doing
One day, I'm beautiful, then I'm ugly
But those days, they remind me that I'm human

So go ahead and rip, tear me apart
'Cause I'm not afraid of my flaws
If the scars on my skin make me ugly
Then let's get ugly
Let's get ugly
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
Let's get ugly
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo
Oh, ugly
