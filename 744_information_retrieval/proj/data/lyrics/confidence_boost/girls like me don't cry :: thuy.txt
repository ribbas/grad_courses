Tell me that you keep me safe and never let this fade away
I'm hiding out so they don't see this part of me

Girls like me don't cry
Girls like me pretend we don't cry
Girls like me don't cry
Girls like me pretend we don't cry
Tell me that you keep me safe and never let this fade away
Girls like me don't cry
Girls like me pretend we don't cry

Lost in the city both eyes wide
Ran right through all my options
Can't seem to keep my eyes both dry
Got tissues in my pocket
I'm sensitive
Prolly wanna duck when I throw a fit
Been through some shit
Wear my heart on my sleeve so it's hard to miss

Tell me that you keep me safe and never let this fade away
I'm hiding out so they don't see this part of me
Girls like me don't cry
Girls like me pretend we don't cry (crybaby)

Girls like me don't cry
Girls like me pretend we don't cry
Tell me that you keep me safe and never let this fade away
I'm hiding out so they don't see this part of me
Girls like me don't cry
Girls like me pretend we don't cry

They say girl don't cry
Try to keep my head up high
Smile like it's alright
But all I want to do is hide
Gotta let it go
Don't wanna keep this all inside

Girls like me don't cry
Girls like me pretend we don't cry (crybaby)
Girls like me don't cry
Girls like me pretend we don't cry
Tell me that you keep me safe and never let this fade away
Girls like me don't cry
Girls like me pretend we don't cry
