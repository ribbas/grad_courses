You, you've got a lot on your plate this week
A lot of promises you couldn't keep, and that's just fine
I'm just trying not to lose my shit this time
Avoiding everything and say I'm fine, and we're out of sync

I'm not sure why nothing makes me feel like getting out of bed
And I'm not sure what's going wrong inside my head

I've honestly never felt this lousy in my life before
It makes no sense to me I should be happy should be thankful for
The friends I have around me, the support of my fractured family
But still I'm just pretending that I'm fine
When I'm feeling lousy all the time
I'm such a fuck

I'm such a fucking piece of shit and you hate me for it
We just haven't really been on the same page
Crossing out wires, oversensitive to everything you say to me but I
I think that I'm so self-aware but I just overthink
Still I never realized how much it's been infecting

I've honestly never felt this lousy in my life before
It makes no sense to me I should be happy should be thankful for
The friends I have around me, the support of my fractured family
But still I'm just pretending that I'm fine when I'm feeling lousy all the time
I'm feeling lousy all the time
