But we're ready to erupt
Now it's payback
Payback
You know you better run
Flying too close to the sun
Now it's payback
Payback)

Girl, I see you getting used to, turn a blind eye
Girl, he keeps you in the dark, it's messing with your mind
I don't want to see you waste another night out
Always looking at your phone like he will call you back

I just can't believe
Thought he could play you easily
Sweet revenge is all you need
It's time, don't send a warning

Think you've got one up
But we're ready to erupt
Now it's payback (Time)
Payback, ooh-ooh
You know you better run
Flying too close to the sun
Now it's payback (Time)
Payback
We're coming for you

Everybody knows he's playing on your heart strings
Rumour has it, he's been getting down with anything
Did he really think that we would never find out?
Girl, I got you now, let's show him what it's all about

I just can't believe
Thought he could play you easily
Sweet revenge is all you need
It's time, don't send a warning

Think you've got one up
But we're ready to erupt
Now it's payback (Time)

You know you better run
Flying too close to the sun
