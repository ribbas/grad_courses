Sometimes I wanna feel the pain
You said you were done
But you're over here naked
In the middle of the day

Sometimes I wanna feel the pain
You said you were done
Fuck what they say, I'm safe in your arms

Sometimes I wanna feel the pain
You said you were done
But you're over here naked
In the middle of the day

So squeeze my heart all day
Squeeze it till it breaks
Fuck what they say, I'm safe in your arms
And if I die in your arms
There'll be a smile on my face

There'll be a smile on my face
There'll be a smile on my f...
There'll be a smile on my f...

Fuck what they say, if I die in your arms
There'll be a smile on my face

There'll be a smile on my face
There'll be a smile on my f...
There'll be a smile on my f...
