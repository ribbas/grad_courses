I'm so sad now
I'm down bad now
She don't like me
Got me very mad now
I'm so sad I feel like I could cry
She's playing video games with another guy

I've only ever seen her online
But damn baby girl is so fine
I'm wishing I could make her mine
Steady plan till the moment's right
I wanna be the only guy in her life
The only one that she chat with all night
Discord calls phone on my bedside
Hold my pillow close like she's by my side

I'm all alone but that's okay
My e-girl loves me at the end of the day
I'm all alone but that's okay
(It's actually not okay, I fucking hate it here)

I'm so sad now
I'm down bad now
She don't like me
Got me very mad now
I'm so sad I feel like I could cry
She's playing video games with another guy
