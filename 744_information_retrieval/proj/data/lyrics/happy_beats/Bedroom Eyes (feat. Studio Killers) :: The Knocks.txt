Ooh la, la la la, la la la
Don't kill me, baby
Ooh la, la la la, la la

We could be a pretty little mess (oh)
Looking like we couldn't care less, baby
It could be, it could be fun
We could be, we could be dumb

Ooh la, la la la, la la la
Don't kill me, baby
Ooh la, la la la, la la la
If I love you, baby
Ooh la, la la la, la la la
I love you, baby
Ooh la, la la la, la la

We could be together, baby, you and me
Ooh, I like you tickling my dancing feet
Spinning round and around, the ceiling's coming down
Go around, we could do it all night

I love it how we hate the same things (oh)
But you could be my karaoke queen, baby
Wickedly, wickedly fun
We could be, we could be dumb

Ooh la, la la la, la la la
Don't kill me, baby
Ooh la, la la la, la la la
If I love you, baby
Ooh la, la la la, la la la
I love you, baby
Ooh la, la la la, la la

We could be together, baby, you and me
Ooh, I like you tickling my dancing feet
Spinning round and around, the ceiling's coming down
Go around, we could do it all night

Ooh la, la la la, la la la
Don't kill me, baby
Ooh la, la la la, la la la
If I love you, baby
Ooh la, la la la, la la la
I love you, baby
Ooh la, la la la, la la

We could be together, baby, you and me
Ooh, I like you tickling my dancing feet
Spinning round and around, the ceiling's coming down
Go around, we could do it all night

We could be together, baby, you and me
Ooh la, la la la, la la la
