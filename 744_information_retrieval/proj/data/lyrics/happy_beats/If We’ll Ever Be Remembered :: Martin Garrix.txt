We all turn to dust when we go
Before we know it
Time just flies away, we lose control, oh

I wonder why we keep trying to chase a feeling
That was always in our hearts
All these mistakes I know we wouldn't make
If we'd go back to the start

If we'll ever be remembered
I hope it'll be for the way that we love
Life gets better, we're together
And one day we'll smile looking down from above

I guess we'll never know when our time will come
But if we'll ever be remembered
I know it'll be for the way that we love

If we'll ever be remembered
I know it'll be for the way that we love
If we'll ever be remembered
I know it'll be for the way that we love

Tainted by the pain when dreams get crushed
But we come back stronger
There's always gotta be a way to not give up, oh

I wonder why we keep trying to chase a feeling
That was always in our hearts
All these mistakes I know we wouldn't make
If we'd go back to the start

If we'll ever be remembered
I hope it'll be for the way that we love
Life gets better, we're together
And one day we'll smile looking down from above

I guess we'll never know when our time will come
But if we'll ever be remembered
I know it'll be for the way that we love

Ooh
If we'll ever be remembered
I know it'll be for the way that we love

If we'll ever be remembered
I hope it'll be for the way that we love

I guess we'll never know when our time will come
But if we'll ever be remembered
I know it'll be for the way that we love
