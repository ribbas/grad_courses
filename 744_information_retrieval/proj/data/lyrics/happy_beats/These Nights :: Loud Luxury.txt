Come closer
To the music
Make me want you
Make me lose it

Oh, come closer
To the music
Need all of your company

And I just wanna feel it
Can you feel it?
Like a melody in the air

And I don't wanna need it
But I need it
Come get high on it if you dare

These nights
We learn to love again
These times
They go and come again

These nights
Make it easy to pretend
Like this night can never end, it's alright, alright

These nights
We learn to love again
These times
They go and come again

These nights
Make it easy to pretend
Like this night can never end, it's alright, alright

These nights

Start a fire
It's a movement
Lift me higher
Get me lucid, oh
Deep desire
Yeah, you gotta use it
Need all of your company

And I just wanna feel it
Can you feel it?
Like a melody in the air

And I don't wanna need it
But I need it
Come get high on it if you dare

These nights
We learn to love again
These times
They go and come again

These nights
Make it easy to pretend
Like this night can never end, it's alright, alright

These nights
We learn to love again
These times
They go and come again

These nights
Make it easy to pretend
Like this night can never end, it's alright, alright

These nights
