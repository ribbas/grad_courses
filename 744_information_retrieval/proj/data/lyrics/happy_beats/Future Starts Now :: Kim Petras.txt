Le futur c'est maintenant

Ain't nobody gonna stop me
Don't you let the music stop now
You're more than just anybody
Don't give up, the future starts now
Worry 'bout it in the morning
Take it to another level
You're more than just anybody
Don't give up, the future starts now

One day everyone will notice
The world is yours and you should know it
So don't let love get out of focus
Don't give up, the future starts now

I know you can take the pressure
Turn it into something better
So take the pain and make it pleasure
Don't give up, the future starts now

Le futur c'est maintenant un, deux, trois, quatre

Ain't nobody gonna stop me
Don't you let the music stop now
You're more than just anybody
Don't give up, the future starts now
Worry 'bout it in the morning
Take it to another level
You're more than just anybody
Don't give up the future starts now

Lose control, take control, anything you want tonight
On a roll, good to go, let the moment blow your mind
Take your time, take your time, baby, it don't matter
Let it ride, let it ride, take it to the afters

Let your heart decide
Let it change your life tonight
Yeah, you're almost there
You can almost touch the light
If you're lost and you find
That you need somebody
In the dark, baby, don't you know the future starts now?

Le futur c'est maintenant un, deux, trois, quatre

Ain't nobody gonna stop me
Don't you let the music stop now
You're more than just anybody
Don't give up, the future starts now
Worry 'bout it in the morning
Take it to another level
You're more than just anybody
Don't give up the future starts now

Le futur c'est maintenant, quatre
