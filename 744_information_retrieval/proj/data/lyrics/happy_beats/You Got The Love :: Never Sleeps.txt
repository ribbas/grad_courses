Feeling like the world is on my shoulders
Sometimes I don't know how to carry on
Thought the wave was gonna take me over
I thought that I could do it on my own

But when the whole world shakes
You're my solid ground
Yeah, you keep me safe
When the lights go out

I found hope in the darkest days
I know you got the love
I found home in a crowded place
I know you got the love

You got the love
I know you got the love
You got the love
I know you got the love

I found hope in the darkest days
I know you got the love
I found home in a crowded place
I know you got the love (you got the love)

Standing in the storm, I needed shelter
Someone who could walk me through the rain (oh)
I don't know how but when we are together
No matter how we been, we never break

But when the whole world shakes
You're my solid ground (oh-whoa)
Yeah, you keep me safe (ooh)
When the lights go out

I found hope in the darkest days
I know you got the love
I found home in a crowded place
I know you got the love

You got the love
I know you got the love
You got the love
I know you got the love

I found hope in the darkest days (oh)
I know you got the love (I know you got)
I found home in a crowded place
I know you got the love (you got the love)
