Love on the table
Watching you move me in silence
The touch of an angel
I'm too afraid to open my eyelids

All those nights I spent dreaming about this (Ahhh)
Felt so real I thought that it was true (Thought it was true)

All I get is deja vu (Ah, ah, ahh)
Lying here right next to you (Ah, ah, ahh)
All I get is deja vu (Ah, ah, ahh)
Tell me that you feel it too (All I get is deja vu)

(Ah, ah, ahh)
Deja vu
(Ah, ah, ahh)
Deja vu
(Ah, ah, ahh)
Deja vu
(Ah, ah, ahh)
Deja vu

Pull me in closer
I let your hands do the talking
Kissing me so good
You better pinch me so I keep on falling

All those nights I spent dreaming about this (Ahhh)
Felt so real I thought that it was true (Thought it was true)

All I get is deja vu (Ah, ah, ahh)
Lying here right next to you (Ah, ah, ahh)
All I get is deja vu (Ah, ah, ahh)
Tell me that you feel it too (All I get is deja vu)

(Ah, ah, ahh)
Deja vu
(Ah, ah, ahh)
Deja vu
(Ah, ah, ahh)
Deja vu
(Ah, ah, ahh)
Deja vu

All I need is your L-O-V-E
All I need is your L-O-V-E (All I need)
All I need is your L-O-V-E
All I need is your L-O-V-E
All I need is your L-O-V-E (All I need)
All I need is your L-O-V-E (All I need)
All I need is your L-O-V-E (All I need)
All I need is your deja vu

(Ah, ah, ahh)
Deja vu
(Ah, ah, ahh)
Deja vu
(Ah, ah, ahh)
Deja vu
(Ah, ah, ahh)
Deja vu
