It was midnight, on my mind
Must have got lost in your eyes
Had a feeling, it's God-like
Swear I had a vision of us touching
The moonlight
I just wanna feel like I'm alive

Said, don't take me home
Take me to a place you've never gone
Where we can lose ourselves till dawn

Somewhere where everybody's dancing
And they're dancing really close
Everybody's heavy breathing
Everybody's toe-to-toe
Just wanna move my body
Up in till my heart explodes
And it beats faster

Can you feel the rapture?
(Can you feel it?)
(Can you feel it?)

Can you feel the rapture?
(Can you feel it?)
(Can you feel it?)
Can you feel it?

Satisfaction, frankincense
Overflowing, get no rest
Candles lit, some fruit to kiss
Paradise with a little risk
Feels like heaven, Elysium
I'm here waiting for you to come
Up through those golden doors
Tr√®s bien, mon amour

I know you like euphoria
We dance for hours, the both of us
Exhilaration, perspiration
On cloud nine, in rotation
Water pools in the dust
This world has enchanted touch
Come and go as you please
But you'll never want to leave

Somewhere where everybody's dancing
And they're dancing really close
Everybody's heavy breathing
Everybody's toe-to-toe
Just wanna move my body
Up in till my heart explodes
And it beats faster

Can you feel the rapture?
(Can you feel it?)
(Can you feel it?)

Can you feel the rapture?
(Can you feel it?)
(Can you feel it?)
(Can you feel it?)

(Can you feel it?)
(Can you feel it?)
Can you feel it?

Can you feel it?
