You know I cant, eat without you
And I cant sleep without you
Stay up all night, writing songs about you
Take me on

And I spend all my days drinking
So I don't have to spend them thinking
And I know that I wont last long this way

Oh, you got me walking ten miles high
Step off, see if I can fly

And my best guess, is too far off
And in my chest, the rhythms' gone
And all of the rest, falls to the side

I sit alone in an empty house
Writing notes while im thinking bout
The few folks, I didn't let down

Oh, you got me walking ten miles high
Step off, see if I can fly
Don't care if I live or die, don't care if I live or die
