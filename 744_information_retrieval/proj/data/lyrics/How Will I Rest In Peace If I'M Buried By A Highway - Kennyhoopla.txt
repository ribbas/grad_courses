She's gonna cut my head off
But I don't care, I don't care
She's gonna cut my head off
But I don't care
They say, "You clean up nice
You look like a dead man
Like a dead man"
She say, "You dress up nice"
I feel like a dead man
A dead man

Culture is so claustrophobic
Claws to prove it hurts so good
And the party's over
I'm still on your couch now, love
Yeah, if there is a line, I know you won't cross it
Take your time (Take your time)
But I might die (But I might die)

She's gonna cut my head off
But I don't care, I don't care
She's gonna cut my head off
But I don't care
They say, "You clean up nice
Just like a dead man
Like a dead man"
She say, "You dress up nice"
I feel like a dead man
A dead man

How can I rest in peace if I'm buried by a highway?
Pain on the keys, is everybody still breathing?
Weight of my shadow, it gets more heavy
And it scares me, yeah
The cherub's a scar
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's when the hearts collide
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Speeding with no drive
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Just let the lie expire
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You say you know that it's fine
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I say I know that it's fine
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You said it's only a fire
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I think it's more than a fire

She's gonna cut my head off
But I don't care, I don't care
She's gonna cut my head off
But I don't care
They say, "You clean up nice (Nice)
Just like a dead man
Like a dead man"
She say, "You dress up nice" (Nice)
I feel like a dead man
A dead man
She's gonna cut my head off
But I don't care, I don't care
She's gonna cut my head off
But I don't care
They say, "You clean up nice (Nice)
Just like a dead man
Like a dead man"
She say, "You dress up nice" (Nice)
I feel like a dead man
A dead man
