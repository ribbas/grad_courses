Please put me in a medically induced coma
Don't make me live awake I'm tired and I don't wanna
Sad and sour 24 fucking hours a day
Bars and flowers on my album cover you don't play

You make me worthless
What if I just threw you away?
My clothes don't fit and I can feel my spine
I can't give up the drugs so I give up on life

Please put me in a medically induced coma
Don't make me live awake I'm tired and I don't wanna

Bad memories on the forefront of my mind
I can't get 'em to leave and a peace I can't find
My bones are broken but I don't feel it
A high potential but of course I blew it

Please put me in a medically induced coma
Don't make me live awake I'm tired and I don't wanna
It be so easy to sleep but I can't
I can't hurt if I'm in a dream so that's the plan

Existence is a problem that I know how to solve
My life would be better if I wasn't involved
I know it sounds crazy but lately oh baby
I wish someone would know how to save me, please save me so

Please put me in a medically induced coma
Don't make me live awake I'm tired and I don't wanna
It be so easy to sleep but I can't
I can't hurt if I'm in a dream so that's the plan
Please put me in a medically induced coma
Please put me in a medically induced coma

It be so easy to leave but I can't
I'll still hurt if you're not with me so fuck the plan
