Ten times out of ten, you know I'd do it all again
Even though I know exactly how it's gonna end
I've seen the world, I've done it all and I've lost a couple friends
But that's life, that's life

So fuck it, let's just go another night
You know the grass is only greener in your mind
This 42 won't drink itself and I don't need nobody else
And that's life, that's life

That's la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-life
That's la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-life

That's la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-life
That's la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-life

Ten times out of ten, I swear there's nothing I would change
What's the point pretending when we all go out the same?
We light it up, we drink it down, we try to ease the pain
And that's life, that's life

So fuck it, let's just go another night
You know the grass is only greener in your mind
This 42 won't drink itself and I don't need nobody else
And that's life, that's life

That's la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-life
That's la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-life

That's la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-life
That's la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-life

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-life
This 42 won't drink itself and I don't need nobody else
And that's life, that's life

Ten times out of ten, you know I'd do it all again
Even though I know exactly how it's gonna end
I've seen the world, I've done it all and I've lost a couple friends
But that's life, that's life
