Birds flying high
You know how I feel
The sun in the sky
You know how I feel
Breeze driftin' on by
You know how I feel
It's a new dawn, it's a new day
And I'm feeling gud

And I'm feeling gud
And I'm feeling gud
And I'm feeling gud

Birds flying high
You know how I feel
The sun in the sky
You know how I feel
Breeze driftin' on by
You know how I feel
It's a new dawn, it's a new day
And I'm feeling gud

And I'm feeling gud
And I'm feeling gud
And I'm feeling gud
And I'm feeling gud
And I'm feeling gud
