Uh rollin' in impalas but you too tame
I ain't from the south but I appreciate the wood grain
Neighbor callin' me about the noise it's only 2 man
Now I'm in the same building but the floors and view changed
I ain't for the waitin' now
I bought a rari and I did it just to hear the sound
Drive safe really boutta lose all its meaning now
Guess you love to travel when I pull up man you're leaving town
Say you're married to the game and I'm just here to burn the gown

I got a flight in the morning
I see what you been tryna do and Imma mission abort it
You think I never pay attention in my mind I'm recording
I'm boutta win and ruin all your goals and dreams out of boredom

Ridin' around with homies like we run the city
Done it
Lookin' fresh and feelin' like a milli
Money
Move in silence you can never hear me
Comin'
If you got a problem when you see me
Run it

Run it
DJ Snake
Rozay

Bang
Tryna show you what we came to do
Boss
Only talkin' makin' major moves
Rolls Royce, no top me
No one will ever stop me
Me against the world, I got my back against the wall
Know I'm hell bound
But I'm well now
On the road to riches I could never lay around
Told her don't make a sound unless she make it loud
Everybody scream
Everybody scream
Everybody scream
That's my only thing
I'm a born winner
A Jordan 23
All my people G's until the party ceased

Run it

Run it
