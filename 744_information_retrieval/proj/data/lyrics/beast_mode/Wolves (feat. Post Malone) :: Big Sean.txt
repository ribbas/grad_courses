I was raised by the wolves (I was raised by)
I was raised by the wolves (I was raised by)

I was raised by the wolves, ate 'til they full
Run through the night, playing with your life
Go against the pack, that's risking your life
Better play it right, yeah, you better play it right

I got loyalty and blood, I do anything for love
And everything for us, doing everything like everything ain't been too much
You know my favorite time to come through for you is the clutch, last second, what a rush
I'm the type to talk to the stars (I look up)
Straight up, these ain't tattoos these are scars
My young dogs will tear you and the witnesses apart (Straight up)
They care about starving more than they do about a charge (Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Me, I can't break a commitment (No)
I done seen people fuck up the whole team 'cause they couldn't play they position
Talking about they didn't mean it, bitch
You know the road to hell was paved with good intentions
I see myself in my nemesis, I contemplated forgiveness, I think I lost all my innocence
Hoe my life depend on this, this ain't no simple sucker shit
Try and steal and you get bit, that's what you motherfucking get
I feel safer taking risks and I can't eat this on my own life
Put my back against the wall just to see how much I've grown dawg

I was raised by the wolves, ate 'til they full
Run through the night, playing with your life
Go against the pack, that's risking your life
Better play it right, better play it right

I was raised by the wolves, ate 'til they full
Run through the night, playing with your life
Go against the pack, that's risking your life
Better play it right, yeah, you better play it right

I was raised by the wolves, paid all my dues
Always in the game and never played by the rules
Try to make me leave, fell down to my knees
Picked myself up and turned my back to the breeze
Oh, oh-oh
Spent a milli on a milli, mama look at me
With all these diamond chokers, man, it's getting hard to breathe
Now that you are family, cut some branches off my tree
But if you in my circle, know I'll always be around
Don't let me down, you said you'd die for me, well, there's the ground
Ice on my wrist, ice in my veins
But it's a cold, cold world, and you can be predator, you can be prey

I was raised by the wolves, ate 'til they full
Run through the night, playing with your life
Go against the pack, that's risking your life
Better play it right, better play it right

I was raised by the wolves, ate 'til they full
Run through the night, playing with your life
Go against the pack, that's risking your life
Better play it right, yeah, you better play it right

I was raised by the wolves (I was raised by)
I was raised by the wolves (I was raised by)
I was raised by the wolves, ate 'til they full
Run through the night, playing with your life
Go against the pack that's risking your life
Better play it right, yeah, you better play it right
