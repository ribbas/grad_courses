You don't have to put on the red light
Those days are over
You don't have to sell your body to the night
(True say)
You don't have to wear that dress tonight
Those days are over
You don't have to put on the red light
(True say)

Those days are over
You don't have to put on the red light
Those days are over
You don't have to put on the red light
Those days are over
You don't have to put on the red light

Those days are over
You don't have to put on the red light
Those days are over
You don't have to put on the red light
