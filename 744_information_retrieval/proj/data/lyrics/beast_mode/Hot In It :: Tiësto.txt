It's Charli, baby
TiÃ«sto

You won't see me cryin' on the bathroom floor
I ain't ever coming back for more
Wanna see you walking out that door, bye bye bye bye
You won't see me begging for a second chance
Say I need you 'cause it don't make sense
Boy, you just lost a ten out of ten, won't lie lie lie

And tonight I'm gon' be rockin' it, droppin' it
Shake my ass, no stoppin' it
I look hot in it, hot in it
I look hot in it

Rockin' it, droppin' it
Shake my ass, no stoppin' it
I look hot in it, hot in it
I look hot in it
Rockin' it, droppin' it
Shake my ass, no stoppin' it
I look hot in it, hot in it
I look hot in it

Tonight I'm gon' be rockin' it, droppin' it
Shake my ass, no stoppin' it
I look hot in it, hot in it
I look hot in it
Tonight I'm gon' be rockin' it, droppin' it
Shake my ass, no stoppin' it
I look hot in it, hot in it
I look hot in it

Moving till my feet get sore
Hands all on me till my dress gets torn
Watch me do it, do it real hardcore, my my my my
You and me, we never ever made much sense
I'm too independent, no offense
Boy, don't be sad about the things I said, don't cry cry cry

Tonight I'm gon' be rockin' it, droppin' it
Shake my ass, no stoppin' it
I look hot in it, hot in it
I look hot in it

(I look hot in it)

Rockin' it, droppin' it
Shake my ass, no stoppin' it
I look hot in it, hot in it
I look hot in it
Tonight I'm gon' be rockin' it, droppin' it
Shake my ass, no stoppin' it
I look hot in it, hot in it
I look hot in it

Tonight I'm gon' be rockin' it, droppin' it
Shake my ass, no stoppin' it
I look hot in it, hot in it
I look hot in it
Tonight I'm gon' be rockin' it, droppin' it
Shake my ass, no stoppin' it
I look hot in it, hot in it
I look hot in it
