I am not the one who like degrading
Why you gotta test my patience
Left you behind like a station
Sorry but you are not the one I'm chasinâ€™
I am not property
You better start speaking to me properly
Getting too many things onto me
And you stil could've been on with me

Ven aqui, ven a bailar
Men don't know how to hablar
You think that it's okay
You know it's not okay
Baby, baby, no pienses que te quiero

Baby, baby, no pienses que te quiero
Baby, baby, no pienses que te quiero
Baby, baby, no pienses que te quiero
Baby, baby, no pienses que te quiero

Hey Ally, Hey Ally
See the things you did
See the effects you had on this girl
I know you ain't tryna do wrong
I know the feelings were strong
God gave you that bond
God gave you that bond

Ven aqui, ven a bailar
Men don't know how to hablar
You think that it's okay
You know it's not okay
Baby, baby, no pienses que te quiero

I am not the one who like degrading
Why you gotta test my patience

I am not property
You better start speaking to me properly
Getting too many things onto me
And you stil could've been on with me

Ven aqui, ven a bailar
Men don't know how to hablar
You think that it's okay
You know it's not okay
Baby, baby, no pienses que te quiero

Baby, baby, no pienses que te quiero
Baby, baby, no pienses que te quiero
Baby, baby, no pienses que te quiero
Baby, baby, no pienses que te quiero
Baby, baby, no pienses que te quiero
Baby, baby, no pienses que te quiero
Baby, baby, no pienses que te quiero
