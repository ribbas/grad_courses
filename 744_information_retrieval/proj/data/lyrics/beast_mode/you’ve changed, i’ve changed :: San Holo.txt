I don't wanna lose my mind again
I remember every word you said
If there was a way I would go back
If there was a way I would go back

I don't wanna lose my mind again
Even if I try, I can't forget
If there was a way I would go back
If there was a way I would go back

You've changed
I've changed
You've changed
It's not the same
You've changed
I've changed
You've changed
It's not the same

I don't wanna lose my mind again
I remember every word you said
If there was a way I would go back
If there was a way I would go back

You've changed

You've changed
It's not the same

I've changed
You've changed
It's not the same

You've changed
I've changed
You've changed
It's not the same

You've changed

You've changed
It's not the same

It's not the same
You've changed
