I got a little bitch from the hood I call her gang
She don't play with that bae shit
I be fuckin this NBA nigga bitch
'Cause she know I ain't never gonna say shit

New contract big like I play ball, little boy
Ain't nothing to play with
I told her pull up she told me she can't
Her nigga be sharing locations

I was riding in the ghost with the ghost gun
Seen you out with your kids so you owe one
And my man in the can while you taking out the trash
He gon' pop up with the mac like don't run

Gave her a pill they all get high, you ever had a foursome?
It's too much cash for me to hide
I had to give little bro some
I fuck her raw from time to time
I don't show no emotion

But when he died he had them racks
He had to make a go fund
I hang with the hitters who train the killers
Who send all the niggas on slow runs
I got me a check, and I bought me a cat
And I went on the block and did donuts

I hang with all the murderers
I'm paying all the lawyers for the murderers
I'm putting all my dice on the murderers
You don't wanna see me with the murderers, murderers

Rolls Royce swervin'
Famous bitch curvin'
Seen you out in traffic
You was looking nervous

Ran it up on accident
Then they thought it was on purpose
I know for a fact I'm blasting mine
I never get too worried
Hundred racks in hundreds
Stick like cursive, I been selling verses

One time I lied inside my song
I ain't gonna buy no Burkin
Homicide on my mind
When I slide I ain't trying see no hearse
He ain't even die by the gun
Took a fake pill, nigga died off percs

Shorty look perfect, pussy was worth it
Go get her some purses
My diamonds be hitting like we in a Versus
We sticking together this shit in a cursive
I'm fuckin' with Durkio
I just left the jeweler with Baby, bought two anniversaries
Go to Atlanta to Copper Cove me
Bad little bitches all on me
Way too ranked up, ain't no exposing me
She wanna go to the mall
Got up and went to the pop up at Louis in Soho and ordered it all
I'm in this bitch with the voice and the hero, these niggas is weirdos
Ain't going this hard
I'm from the P, that's gang
All these niggas know me I hang with...

I hang with all the murderers
I'm paying all the lawyers for the murderers
I'm putting all my dice on the murderers
You don't wanna see me with the murderers, murderers
