Ah, for now, I'll just let go
And ah, run up the tab and lose control

No, we ain't got no plans like we did back then
Takes me back to how we used to feel

We're going savage, we couldn't care less
No matter how hangover I get I'll do it over again
Ravage, let's do some damage
And if I'm getting sober then I will do it over again

Do it over again
Do it over again
Do it over again
Do it over again
Do it over
Do it over
Do it over
Do it over
Do it over
Then I will do it over again

No, we ain't got no plans like we did back then
Takes me back to how we used to feel

We're going savage, we couldn't care less
No matter how hangover I get I'll do it over again
Ravage, let's do some damage
And if I'm getting sober then I will do it over again

Do it over again
Do it over again
Do it over again
Do it over again
Do it over
Do it over
Do it over
Do it over
Do it over
Then I will do it over again
