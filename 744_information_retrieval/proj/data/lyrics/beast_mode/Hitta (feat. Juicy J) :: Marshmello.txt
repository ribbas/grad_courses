(One hitta quitta, one hitta quitta, one hitta quitta, one hitta quitta)
Ma-ma-mafia!
Shut da fuck up! Yeah

I got that one hitta quitta, that one hitta quitta-quitta
One hitta quitta, that one hitta quitta
Nigga find out and get your fucking teeth knocked out
Find out and get your fucking teeth knocked out
I got that one hitta quitta, that one hitta quitta-quitta
One hitta quitta, that one hitta quitta
Nigga find out and get your fucking teeth knocked out
Find out and get your fucking teeth knocked out

One, one, one, one (Kill this shit)
One, one, one, one, one hitta quitta
One, one, one, one (Kill this shit)
One, one, one, one
Shut the fuck up! (Yeah, yeah, your boy Juicy J, yeah)

Pulling up and rolling up
Smoked out in exotic trucks
Model chicks, they like to suck with lots of spit like Daffy Duck
Halo on me, I'm too high, take two puffs and touch the sky
Weed strong, money long, got more cake than Dunkin Hines
Haters in the atmosphere, can't see you through these Cartiers
You can say I'm kinda blind, I don't see nothing but dollar signs
Chains on my neck like gold metals
Can't go vegan with all this cheddar
Juicy and big Marshmello
Killing shit, bring Paul back
Valet bring my car 'round
Dripped so hard I thought I drowned
Took so many nigga hoes, I'm about to start a lost and found
Private party, private jet
She wanna share her private parts
I got that one hitta quitta
I'm about to knock that out the park

I got that one hitta quitta, that one hitta quitta-quitta
One hitta quitta, that one hitta quitta
Nigga find out and get your fucking teeth knocked out
Find out and get your fucking teeth knocked out
I got that one hitta quitta, that one hitta quitta-quitta
One hitta quitta, that one hitta quitta
Nigga find out and get your fucking teeth knocked out
Find out and get your fucking teeth knocked out

One, one, one, one, one (Kill this shit)
One, one, one, one, one, one, one hitta quitta
One, one, one, one, one
One, one, one, one, one, one, one hitta quitta

(One hitta quitta, one hitta quitta-quitta, one hitta quitta, one hitta quitta-quitta)
