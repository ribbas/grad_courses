There is a break in the light
There is a place I can hide
Where all the colors collide
And the flame, it keeps me alive
Might lose a part of my mind
Searching for what I can't find
Held by the dark of the night
And your flame, it keeps me alive

And all I need is to be hit by you
All I need is to be free by you
Be free by you
And your flame, it keeps me alive

Alive, alive
Alive

And all I need is to be hit by you
All I need is to be be free by you
Be free by you
And your flame, it keeps me alive

I'm gonna fight for my life
Fighting the fight for what's right
Come out the dark of the night
But your flame, it keeps me alive

And all I need is to be hit by you
All I need is to be free by you
Be free by you
And your flame, it keeps me alive

Alive, alive
Alive

And all I need is to be hit by you
All I need is to be free by you
Be free by you
And your flame, it keeps me alive

Alive, alive
Alive
And your flame, it keeps me alive
