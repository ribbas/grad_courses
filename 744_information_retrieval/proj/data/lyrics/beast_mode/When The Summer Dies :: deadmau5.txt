I see the colors change when I look at the sky
They tell me life is too short to listen to the lies
Riding a plastic waterfall, I tell myself I
Won't feel a thing when the summer dies

Hey there, can you follow me?
Love is all you need
Nothing really matters if you never believe
Hey there, can you feel me now?
Baby, close your eyes
If you like this feeling let that black smoke rise

Black smoke
Black smoke rise
Black smoke
Black smoke rise
Black smoke
Black smoke rise
Black smoke
Black smoke rise

So hang the DJ, play pretend
Burn the city, fuck your friends
And sing along
Sing along

Hang the DJ, play pretend
Burn the city, fuck your friends
And sing along
Sing along

So hang the DJ, play pretend
Burn the city, fuck your friends
And sing along
Sing along

Hang the DJ, play pretend
Burn the city, fuck your friends
And sing along
Sing along

Sing along
Sing along
Sing along
Sing along
Sing along
Sing along
Sing along
Sing along

Black smoke
Black smoke
Black smoke

Nobody got nothing on the creative curse
Stuck on a thousand ideas and only one that works
What I first thought would be bad or worse
Singing our song in our blacked-out hearse

Ooh, these little friends got me feeling alright
Take me higher at night
Ooh, these violent ends, baby, cross my eyes
Let the black smoke rise

Black smoke
Black smoke rise
Black smoke
Black smoke rise
Black smoke
Black smoke rise
Black smoke
Black smoke rise
