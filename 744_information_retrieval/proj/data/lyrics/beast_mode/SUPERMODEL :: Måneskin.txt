Alone at parties in a deadly silhouette
She loves the cocaine but cocaine don't love her back
When she's upset she talks to "Maury" and takes deep breaths
She's a 90s supermodel
Way back in high school when she was a good Christian
I used to know her but she's got a new best friend
A drag queen named the Virgin Mary takes confessions
She's a 90s supermodel

Yeah, she's a master
My compliments
If you wanna love her
Just deal with that
She'll never love you
More than money and cigarettes
Every night's a heartbreak

Hey, don't think about it
Hey, just let it go
'Cause her boyfriend is the rock-and-roll
Savor every moment
'Til she has to go
'Cause her boyfriend is the rock-and-roll

Alone at parties
She's working around the clock
When you're not looking she's stealing your Basquiat
Low-waisted pants on OnlyFans
I'll pay for that
She's a 90s supermodel

Yeah, she's a master
My compliments
If you wanna love her
Just deal with that
She'll never love you
You just look a bit like her dad
Every night's a heartbreak

Hey, don't think about it
Hey, just let it go
'Cause her boyfriend is the rock and roll
Savor every moment
'Til she has to go
'Cause her boyfriend is the rock and roll

Yeah
She's a 90s supermodel
