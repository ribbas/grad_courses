(Young Nick Papz, make it slap)

I been on the road, I'm gone
Private jet for me and the bros
Hit H. Lorenzo pick up clothes
I made a finsta to hit my hoes up
They don't know what I'm on, I'm on one
It ain't 'bout right now, it's the long run
I been actin' way too humble
Graduated the streets with honors
I cashed out with all blue hunnids
I see through that cap shit, cut it out
Way too young 'n turnt to settle down
I built niggas up to let me down
World know I take care of everybody
They can't keep up tabs on my whereabouts
Actin' like it's smoke, we gone air 'em out
Turn a nigga crib to a scary house

Roll me up one, tell my chauffeur
Pull my car up to the driveway
Wake her up, tell her her ride here
Gotta get my day goin'
The majority of this shit, I can't show 'em
How I'm movin' like I got eight arms
Tryna get my hands in everything
I like money, I don't cherish fame

I ain't tryna see her, I'ma detox for the next few days
She like me 'cause I'm G, buy her Givenchy
Every time you look up, I be doing somethin' else, yeah, that's me
I don't do too much, that's P
These hoes so embarrassing
I ain't tryna see her, I'ma detox for the next few days
She like me 'cause I'm G, buy her Givenchy
Every time you look up, I be doing somethin' else, yeah, that's me
I don't do too much, that's P
These hoes so embarrassing

One life, two kids, three houses, four gang, five-hundred for a show
Six rings, MJ, seven days, niggas weak
Eight cars I don't drive
Nine times outta ten, I'm gon' be the one to win
Runnin' up a lotta shit
Gotta get 'em 'fo the summer end

They play fake crazy, Ion bar that
You just got turnt, don't start that
I just gotta call it how I call it
All of us stiff, we don't wanna talk
Key to the streets, I unlocked them
She fuck good but she toxic
Erybody lit when we pop out
Narcs think we sellin' narcotics
In staff meetings talkin' 'bout the artists
Business savvy like I went to college
Black card, Goyard wallet
Money clean, IRS can audit it
I still feel like I ain't where I oughta be
Everyday, I'm workin', gettin' closer
Known for putting the team on my shoulders
Boss bitch shit, she a grown up

I ain't tryna see her, I'ma detox for the next few days
She like me 'cause I'm G, buy her Givenchy
Every time you look up, I be doing somethin' else, yeah, that's me
I don't do too much, that's P
These hoes so embarrassing
I ain't tryna see her, I'ma detox for the next few days
She like me 'cause I'm G, buy her Givenchy
Every time you look up, I be doing somethin' else, yeah, that's me
I don't do too much, that's P
These hoes so embarrassing
