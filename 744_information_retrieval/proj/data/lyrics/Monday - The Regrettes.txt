Open my door, I step between my clothes
Can't find the floor, yeah it's been like this before
Still washing stains but I know they won't fade
These growing pains, they push me till I break

I'm pulling down my eyelids two at a time
I swear it's just my sinuses, I'll be fine
An existential crisis and it's only a Monday
Tell me I'm alive
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah

Gotta get the fuck out of LA (Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
Run from the sun before it burns my brain (Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
I'll cut the brakes
Hey, I'm still alive (Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)

No sympathy, don't look at me that way
'Cause physically, well I'm falling into space
And typically, yeah, I'd wrap it in a bow
But honestly, the cracks, they start to show

I'm pulling down my eyelids two at a time
I swear it's just my sinuses, I'll be fine
An existential crisis and it's only a Monday
Tell me I'm alive
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah

Gotta get the fuck out of LA (Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
Run from the sun before it burns my brain (Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
I'll cut the brakes
Hey, I'm still alive (Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)

I'm pulling down my eyelids two at a time
I swear it's just my sinuses, I'll be fine
An existential crisis and it's only a Monday
Tell me I'm alive
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah

Gotta get the fuck out of LA (Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
Run from the sun before it burns my brain (Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
I'll cut the brakes
Hey, I'm still alive (Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
