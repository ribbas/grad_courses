i pick you up from the airport your smile did not feel the same ask you a question then watch as you shot it down like a plane and i am not be too dramat i am the one who bought your flight i knew i should not have told you how much i make a week and we both think that it is stupid that they pay me just to sing and i can sing for you for free but it is just never quit as special as the first time i sang you first day of my life we both thought bright eye was old news but the song still made you smile and i feel like it is been a while sinc your light shone on my account but when you are not around i turn into someth i am not lost or found i am neither i am noth when you are not around there is not much to say hear me yell out loud my love went away hear me shout
