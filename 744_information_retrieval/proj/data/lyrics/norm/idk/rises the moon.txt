day seem sometim as if they will never end sun dig it heel to taunt you but after sunlit day one thing stay the same rise the moon day fade into a watercolour blur memori swim and haunt you but look into the lake shimmer like smoke rise the moon ohoh close your weari eye i promis you that soon the autumn come to darken fade summer sky breath breath breath day pull you down just like a sink ship float is get harder but tread the water child and know that meanwhil rise the moon day pull you up just like a daffodil uproot from it garden they will tell you what you owe but know even so rise the moon you will be visit by sleep i promis you that soon the autumn come to steal away each dream you keep breath breath breath
