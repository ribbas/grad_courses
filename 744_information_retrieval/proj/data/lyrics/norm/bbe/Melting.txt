you are my church you are my place of worship i heard you are the plug can i be the circuit when i got court i hope that you are the verdict when you are around my insid turn invert my blood start to rush when i see you darl i know you are nearbi and i know your purpos take one look at you you are heaven incarn what is this spell babi pleas show some merci chorus melt like an ice cream when you smile melt you are a daydream stay a while i pray that i can learn to be funni i am watch everi standup comedi just hope that it will rub off on me so you will smile at everyth i say you got some soft lip and some pear white i wanna touch them with the dead of night your smile ignit just like a candlelight then somehow i know everyth alright chorus x2
