to the center of the citi where all road meet wait for you to the depth of the ocean where all hope sank search for you well i was move through the silenc without motion wait for you in a room without a window in the corner i found truth in the shadow play act out your own death know no more as the assassin all group in four line danc on the floor and with cold steel odour on their bodi made a move to connect but i could onli stare in disbelief as the crowd all left woo i did everyth everyth i want to i let them use you for their own end to the center of the citi in the night wait for you to the center of the citi in the night wait for you woo
