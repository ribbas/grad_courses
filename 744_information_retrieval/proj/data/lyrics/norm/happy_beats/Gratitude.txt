there are moment in the day when i just lose myself in sorrow and forget how the sky has been much bluer and my life just so much sweeter sinc we met you make my day with what you say a world of calm insid your arm i hope you know the love you bring the song you sing i overflow i hope you know i hope you know my current mood is gratitud my current mood is gratitud
