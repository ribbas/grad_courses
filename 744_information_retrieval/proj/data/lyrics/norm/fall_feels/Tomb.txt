been search for someon of my own kind play it back and forth prefer to rewind you have been live your life from the outsid like a stranger insid of your own mind both been on the rise and fall buri in a tomb and lost like past vision of osiri now i walk into your life at the wrong time never quit been percept of real life it was not your fault or a fault of mine but it is hard to let you go this time both been on the rise and fall buri in a tomb and lost like past vision of osiri now you were on my lap i felt your heartbeat as you press your chest hard against me it was not of this world or of a dream for the first time someon els love me
