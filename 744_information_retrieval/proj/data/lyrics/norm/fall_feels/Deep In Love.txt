down in the valley the first of may gatherin flower both fresh and gay gatherin flower both red and blue how littl thought of what what love could do do not you break my heart do not you break my heart i put my hand in into the bush find the sweetest sweetest rose i prick my finger deep to the line and left the sweetest rose sweetest rose behind do not you break my heart do not you break my heart saw a ship sailin on the big blue sea she sail as deep as deep as she could be but not so deep in in love as i am i cannot whether i i sink or swim do not you break my heart do not you break my heart thousand and thousand all on this earth
