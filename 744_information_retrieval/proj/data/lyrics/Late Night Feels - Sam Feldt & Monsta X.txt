What if we go missin'?
Turn off both our phones
Making bad decisions
Do some things we won't
Do when they listening, yeah
Proofs in the kitchen, hmm
We the only witness, ooh, oh, ooh, oh

Just keepin' it real
You know you're a steal
Like twelve out of twelve, you're my ideal
I know you got taste, like
If Gucci made cakes right
I'd take two ooh, ooh, ooh

Know what to do with these late night feels, late night feels
I want you, baby
Know whatcha do in those late night heels, late night heels
Yeah, ooh-ooh

Shorty, can I meet you in the lobby?
You know we ain't waiting for nobody
Know what to do with these late night feels, late night feels, woo

Late night heels, late night heels
Yeah, ooh-ooh
Late night heels, late night feels, ooh

We've been livin' in that midnight life
Sippin' with the same things in mind
It's true, ooh, yeah
They've been telling me I'm wasting time
With my hands around your waistline
Not true, ooh, yeah-yeah

Just keepin' it real
You know you're a steal
Like twelve out of twelve, you're my ideal
I know you got taste, like
If Gucci made cakes right
I'd take two ooh, ooh, ooh

Know what to do with these late night feels, late night feels
I want you, baby
Know whatcha do in those late night heels, late night heels
Yeah, ooh-ooh

Shorty, can I meet you in the lobby?
You know we ain't waiting for nobody
Know what to do with these late night feels, late night feels, ooh

Late night heels, late night heels
Yeah, ooh-ooh
Late night heels, late night feels, ooh
