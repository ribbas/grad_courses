Think of what you're saying before you speak
These days I can go without enemies

We're killing off the option to make amends
Oh darling, sometimes there's no such thing as more than friends
Let's save what we can before it ends

Nobody loves me like you
Nobody loves me like you

Settling is the sign of a dying man
Comfort in exchange for the promised land
Waiting for the other to break or bend
Oh baby, sometimes there's no such thing as more than friends
Let's save what we can before it ends

Nobody loves me like you [x13]
