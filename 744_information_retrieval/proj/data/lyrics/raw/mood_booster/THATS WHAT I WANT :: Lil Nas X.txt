1, 2, 3, 4
Need a boy who can cuddle with me all night
Keep me warm, love me long, be my sunlight
Tell me lies, we can argue, we can fight
Yeah we did it before but we'll do it tonight
That afro' black boy with the gold teeth
He dark skin looking at me like he know me
I wonder if he got the G or the B
Let me find out and see, he coming over to me, yeah

These days I'm way too lonely
I'm missing out, I know
These days I'm way too alone
And I'm known for giving love away but

I want
Someone to love me
I need
Someone who needs me
'Cause it don't feel right when it's late at night
And it's just me in my dreams
So I want
Someone to love
That's what I fucking want

Look
You know it's harder to find in these times
But I got nothin' but love on my mind
I need a baby while I'm in my prime
Need an adversary to my down and weary
Like tell me there's life when I'm stressing at night
Be like, "You'll be okay" and "Everything is alright", uh
Love me or nothing 'cause I'm not wanting anything
But your loving, your body, and a little bit of ya brain

These days I'm way too lonely
I'm missing out, I know
These days I'm way too alone
And I'm known for giving love away but

I want
Someone to love me
I need
Someone who needs me
'Cause it don't feel right when it's late at night
And it's just me in my dreams
So I want
Someone to love
That's what I fucking want

I want
Someone to love me
I need
Someone who needs me
'Cause it don't feel right when it's late at night
And it's just me in my dreams
So I want
Someone to love
That's what I fucking want
