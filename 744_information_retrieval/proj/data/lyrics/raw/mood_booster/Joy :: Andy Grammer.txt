Me and fear, we had a thing in 1993
Told me I was wasting time with all these silly dreams
I dated doubt, she knocked me down every time I tried
But I found joy in my life

Sorrow swept me off my feet in 2009
I took long walks on the beach next to the oceans that we cried
And grief she came and overstayed way longer than I'd liked
But I found joy in my life

I found joy, yeah, she opened up my eyes
Gave me wings and halo rings and taught me how to fly
Woo, ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo, I feel like a million lights
I found joy in my life

And got me like yeah-ah-ah, ooo-ooo-ooo
I found joy in my life
And got me like yeah-ah-ah, ooo-ooo-ooo
I found joy in my life

Pressure pushed me to the edge, she worked me to the bone
And jealousy, she lied to me, said I needed things I don't
Shame, she had a way to make me hate myself inside
But I found joy in my life

I found joy on the loneliest of nights
I bought a rock, I tied the knot, and I'm making her my wife
Woo, ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo, I feel like a million lights
I found joy in my life

And got me like yeah-ah-ah, ooo-ooo-ooo
I found joy in my life
And got me like yeah-ah-ah, ooo-ooo-ooo
I found joy in my life

There were days I did not know
If she would pack her bags and go
That's my girl forever though
And she knows, she knows

I found joy and I kiss her every night
She gave me two more of her and I can't believe they're mine
Mmm, now I'm basking in their light
I found joy, I found joy

Yeah-ah-ah, ooo-ooo-ooo
I found joy in my life
And got me like yeah-ah-ah, ooo-ooo-ooo
I found joy in my life

I found joy in my life
