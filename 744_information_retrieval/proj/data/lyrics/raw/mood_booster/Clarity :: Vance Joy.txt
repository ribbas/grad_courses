The day began like all the rest
A frantic beating in my chest
A panicked reeling in my brain
Perspective lost but nothing gained
I was so stuck inside my shell
Then the ground began to sway
I realized what mattered most
To me

When the stars began to fall right out of the sky
And the seas were rising up, I had one thing in mind
It was you, it was you, it was you
It was you, it was you, it was you
When the road began to crumble in front of my eyes
There was only one person I wanted to find
It was you, it was you, it was you
It was you, it was you, it was you
Darling, hey, hey, hey

The precious moments that we shared
You slowed time down inside my head
I wish I'd found this clarity
While I still had you close to me

But I was stuck inside my shell
Until the ground began to sway
I realized what mattered most, that day

When the stars began to fall right out of the sky
And the seas were rising up, I had one thing in mind
It was you, it was you, it was you
It was you, it was you, it was you
When the road began to crumble in front of my eyes
There was only one person I wanted to find
It was you, it was you, it was you
It was you, it was you, it was you
Darling, hey, hey, hey

When the stars began to fall right out of the sky
And the seas were rising up, I had one thing in mind
It was you, it was you, it was you
It was you, it was you, it was you
When the road began to crumble in front of my eyes
There was only one person I wanted to find
It was you, it was you, it was you
It was you, it was you, it was you
Darling, hey, hey, hey

It was you, it was you, it was you
Darling, hey, hey, hey

It was you, it was you, it was you
