Runnin' through this strange life
Chasin' all them green lights
Throwin' off the shade for a little bit of sunshine
Hit me with them good vibes
Pictures on my phone like
Everything is so fire
A little bit of sunshine

Crazy lately I'm confirmin'
Tryna write myself a sermon
You just tryna get a word in, life is not fair
I been workin' on my tunnel vision
Tryna get a new prescription
Takin' swings and even missin' but I don't care

I'm dancin' more just a little bit
Breathin' more just a little bit
Care a little less just a little bit
Like life is woo-hoo!
I'm makin' more just a littlе bit
Spend a little more to gеt rid of it
Smile a little more and I'm into it

I, I, I, I-I've been runnin' through this strange life
Chasin' all them green lights
Throwin' off the shade for a little bit of sunshine
Hit me with them good vibes
Pictures on my phone like
Everything is so fire
A little bit of sunshine

A little bit of sunshine
A little bit of sunshine

Another day, another selfish moment
I've been feelin' helpless
Sick of seein' all the selfies, now I don't care
Found myself a new vocation
Calibrated motivation
No more static, change the station
Head to somewhere

I'm dancin' more just a little bit
Breathin' more just a little bit
Care a little less just a little bit
Like life is woo-hoo!
I'm makin' more just a little bit
Spend a little more to get rid of it
Smile a little more and I'm into it

But honestly man, lately I-I've been runnin' through this strange life
Chasin' all them green lights
Throwin' off the shade for a little bit of sunshine
Hit me with them good vibes
Pictures on my phone live
Everything is so fire
A little bit of sunshine

A little bit of sunshine
A little bit of sunshine

I don't really know any other way to say this
Can't slow down tryna keep up with the changes
Punch that number in the name when I clock in
And now I feel like Michael with a cane when I walk in
Basically life is the same thing
Unless you don't want the same thing
Probably shoulda went and got a feature, but I didn't
I've been savin' up the money 'cause it's better for the business

I-I've been runnin' through this strange life
Chasin' all them green lights
Throwin' off the shade for a little bit of sunshine (Yeah)

A little bit of sunshine (Ohh yeah)
A little bit of sunshine
