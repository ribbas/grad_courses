Where am I supposed to be
Washed up, pushed out or on my feet
Tell me is this a dream
Or am I stuck in a movie scene

Daily, lately
I'm spinnin' away so crazy
So baby, just take me

I think I'm caught up in the way I feel 'bout you
I don't know how I can be so drawn in, to you
I think I'm fallin' in deep
I think I'm caught up in the wave of you, of you

Oh upside down, I'm tip-toein' undersea
Lost and found, I hide in a memory
Crossin' lines, am I gonna make it
To the other side or do I have to chase it

Oh I speak loud but don't hear my voice
Ten feet down doesn't feel like choice
Hangin' on to the words you say
But every time I listen I just hear white noise
And all I see are these flashin' lights
Can't hold on while they're passin' by
How many wrongs does it take to right
How many wrongs does it take to right

Daily, lately
I'm spinnin' around so crazy
So baby, just take me

I think I'm caught up in the way I feel 'bout you
I don't know how I can be so drawn in, to you
I think I'm fallin' in deep
I think I'm caught up in the wave of you, of you

Daily, lately
I'm spinnin' around so crazy
So baby, just take me

Daily, lately
I'm spinnin' around so crazy
So baby, just take me

I think I'm caught up in the way I feel 'bout you
I don't know how I can be so drawn in, to you
I think I'm fallin' in deep
I think I'm caught up in the wave of you, of you
