Doesn't this guitar sound so good?
Mmh, mmh-mh
So sweet

Living in this big blue world
With my head up in outer space
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K
When I see trouble come my way
I be making lemonade
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K (mmh-mh) (yeah)

Hey little lady, I know you're feeling crazy (woo)
All your other friends are busy making them babies (ew)
Been out in the real world, don't like how it's tasting (yum)
Let me change your mind with my little old saying (what?)
Two-four-six-eight, who do we appreciate?
Put some sugar in my water (yeah) 'cause we making Minute Maid (woo)
Fuck all the hate (uh), do a shimmie shake (oh)
Throw a middle finger up and down the interstate

Living in this big blue world (world)
With my head up in outer space (outer space)
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K (A-O-K)
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K (mmh-mh)
When I see trouble come my way (my way)
I be making lemonade (lemonade)
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K (mmh-mh)

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na (A-O, A-O-K)
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na (A-O, A-O-K)

I'd be lying if I said I knew the way (oh, I'd be lying)
I just eat shit and pretend that it's gourmet
I've had terrible, horrible, no-good, very bad days
But I'm a G, can't you see that I will always be, uh-uh A-O-K

Uh-uh A-O-K, I'm gon' be
Uh-uh A-O-K, you gon' be
Uh-uh A-O-K, we gon' be
Uh-uh A-O-K, sugar, sugar

Living in this big blue world (blue world)
With my head up in outer space (outer space)
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K (A-O-K)
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K (mmh-mh)
When I see trouble come my way (my way)
I be making lemonade (lemonade)
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K
I know I'll be A-O, A-O-K (A-O-K, what)

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na (A-O, A-O-K)
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na (A-O, A-O-K)
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na (A-O, A-O-K)
