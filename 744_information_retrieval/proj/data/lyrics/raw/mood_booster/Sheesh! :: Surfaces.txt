You know what I'm sayin'?
(Sheesh)

I be like sheesh (Sheesh)
Sunset on the beach (Beach)
Make me wanna pull up on Miami with the heat (Heat)
I don't know 'bout you (You)
But I know 'bout me (Me)
Summertime in Florida, catch me slidin' on the keys (Oh, yeah)

Oh, something's happened inside of me
Excellence, yeah, it's gotta be
Hot and cold, it's dichotomy
Rock with me, we some prodigies
La-di, da-di, we party
They hear us down in the lobby
We tried to tell 'em to join us
And if they don't, they'll be sorry
No time to be out here hatin'
It's history in the makin'
I'm lovin' all of the offers
Got everything that they sayin'
My momma proud, yeah, she oughta be
Elton John keep on callin' me
But even if he didn't, she still think we hit the lottery (Hi, it's Elton)

Don't need diamonds to be cold
I'm so shiny, I'm like gold
You just gotta let it show
Run it back and let's reload

Yeah, I be like sheesh (Sheesh)
Sunset on the beach (Beach)
Make me wanna pull up on Miami with the heat (Heat)
I don't know 'bout you (You)
But I know 'bout me (Me)
Summertime in Florida, catch me slidin' on the keys

Yeah, uh, I'm slidin'
My looks could kill, they violent
Look at me, look at me
I'm the captain and pilot (Pilot)
I'm on an island, private (Private)
Don't ask me what the vibe is (Vibe is)
I can't define it, can't even put that stuff down in writing (Writing, whoo)
Yeah, sun shinin', 24/7, clouds floatin'
Wait, is this Heaven?
Didn't even die to get here, yeah
Look over the top, it's so clear, yeah
Everything I need is right here, yeah
Everything I need is right here, yeah

Don't need diamonds to be cold (Diamonds)
I'm so shiny, I'm like gold (Gold)
You just gotta let it show, oh, oh
Run it back and let's reload (Uh, yeah, let's reload, hey)

Yeah, I be like sheesh (Sheesh)
Sunset on the beach (Beach)
Make me wanna pull up on Miami with the heat (Heat)
I don't know 'bout you (You)
But I know 'bout me (Me)

Make me wanna pull up on Miami with the heat (With the heat)
