Things haven't been quite the same
There's a haze on the horizon, babe
It's only been a couple of days and I miss you
Mmm, yeah
When nothing really goes to plan
You stub your toe or break your camera
I'll do everything I can to help you through

If you're feeling down
I just wanna make you happier, baby
Wish I was around
I just wanna make you happier, baby

We've been doing all this late night talking
'Bout anything you want until the morning
Now you're in my life
I can't get you off my mind

I've never been a fan of change
But I'd follow you to any place
If it's Hollywood or Bishopsgate, I'm coming too
(Ooh-woo)

If you're feeling down
I just wanna make you happier, baby
Wish I was around
I just wanna make you happier, baby

We've been doing all this late night talking
'Bout anything you want until the morning
Now you're in my life
I can't get you off my mind

Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind (Can't get you off my mind)
I won't even try (I won't even try)
To get you off my mind (Get you off my mind)

We've been doing all this late night talking
'Bout anything you want until the morning
Now you're in my life
I can't get you off my mind

Can't get you off my mind (All this late night talking)
Can't get you off my mind (All this late night talking)
I won't even try (All this late night talking)
Can't get you off my
All this late night talking
