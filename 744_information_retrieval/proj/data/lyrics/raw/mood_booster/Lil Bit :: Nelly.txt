Pull up to the club, just to get, to get ahead, right
I do this shit every night
You can call it limelight, I'ma call it my life
Shawty looking alright
TK jeans on, ski-ski-skintight
She be shaking that taillight
Got me froze on the road like a deer in the headlights
Oh, backwoods wanna know if you can roll
Got CÎROC on the rocks, ice-cold
Got the coupe on the new town road
Real low, oh

I know we just met, but girl let's roll
Let's roll (whoa), let's roll, let's roll (hey)
I'll go anywhere you wanna go
Let's go (oh-oh)

And she said, "Take me to the country, show me where you from"
I said, "Shawty, you gon' love me and we gon' have some fun"
I bring out my big wheel and you can climb on up
Girl, I think you a big deal, now show your boy some love (huh)

From the front to the back, hip-hop or the hoedown
Got the game on a go route, I'm the black Tom Brady in this, I'm the GOAT now

I know we just met, but girl let's roll
Let's roll (whoa), let's roll, let's roll (hey)

Let's go (whoa) (ay, ay)

And she said, "Take me to the country, show me where you from" (let's ride)
I said, "Shawty, you gon' love me and we gon' have some fun"
I bring out my big wheel and you can climb on up
Girl, I think you a big deal, now show your boy some love (huh)
Just a lil bit, just a lil bit (yeah, baby)
