(You're my cold heart)
(Oh)

[Elton John:]
It's a human sign
When things go wrong
When the scent of her lingers
And temptation's strong

Cold, cold heart
Hard done by you (Oh)
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through (No, no, no, no, no)

[Dua Lipa:]
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no
And this is what I should have said
Well, I thought it, but I kept it hid

[Elton John:]
Cold, cold heart
Hard done by you (Oh)
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through (No, no, no, no, no)

[Dua Lipa:]
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no (No, no, no, no, no)
And this is what I should have said
Well, I thought it, but I kept it hid
