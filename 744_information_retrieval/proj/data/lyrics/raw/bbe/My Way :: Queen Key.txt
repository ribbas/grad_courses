Queen shit bitch!

These hoes don't know what life about
If money talk, then when the bitch converse
She type it out
That nigga can't get no cash
He just swipe it out
My generation going down hill
It's wiping out
Meanwhile I'm turnt as fuck
I left my pizza in the oven
That bitch burnt as fuck
A lot a cheese to go around
Bitch I could turn you up
A lot of these lil bitches cool
But they be weak as fuck
Time to sweep it up, neat as fuck

My way, my way, or the highway
(I got my own shit, I think I'm on bitch)
My way, my way, or the highway
My way, my way, or the driveway
(I got my own shit, I think I'm on bitch)
My way, my way
My way, my way, my way
My way, my way, my way
M-my way, my way, or the highway
My way, my way, my way

I'm a spoiled as bitch, ima get what I wish
If that nigga got a problem, he can suck his own dick
I got my own shit
I think I'm on bitch
I'm 21 years old and I got my own business
My way
Told that nigga ima business
My way
Bitch mind yo fuckin' business
My way
I got zero fuckin' children
My way
I'm just focused on them millions

Call it my way
Yo nigga get no play
Cuz a nigga got no weight
And he so gay
Cuz a nigga gone obey anything I'm gone say
Cuz I'm Queen Key
And that bitch wanna be me
And that nigga wanna see me
But I leave that bitch like poof
My bundles blowing out the roof
On the highway
Left yo nigga in my driveway
You ain't know, he be there every Friday
Goofy bitch
Damn near my bae
My bae

Bitch, my way
My way, my way, my way
My way, my way
