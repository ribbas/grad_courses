She's alright
That girl's alright with me
Yeah

Ay, yo

I can lick it, I can ride it
While you slippin' and slidin'
I can do all them little tricks and keep the dick up inside it
You can smack it, you can grip it
You can go down and kiss it
And every time he leave me 'lone, he always tell me he miss it
He want a F-R-EEEEE-A-K
F-R-EEEEE-A-K, A-K, A-K, A-K
EEEEE-A-K
F-R-EEEEE-A-K

One thing about me, I'm the baddest alive
He know the prettiest bitch didn't come until I arrive
I don't let bitches get to me, I fuck they man if they try
I got a princess face, a killer body, samurai mind
They can't be Nicki, they so stupid, I just laugh when they try
A thong bikini up my ass, I think I'll go for a dive
His ex bitch went up against me, but she didn't survive
On applications I write, "Pressure", 'cause that's what I apply (Brrrr)
Pressure applied, can't fuck a regular guy
Wetter than umbrellas and stickier than Apple Pie

I can lick it, I can ride it
While you slippin' and slidin'
I can do all them little tricks and keep the dick up inside it
You can smack it, you can grip it
You can go down and kiss it
And every time he leave me 'lone, he always tell me he miss it
He want a F-R-EEEEE-A-K
F-R-EEEEE-A-K, A-K, A-K, A-K
EEEEE-A-K
F-R-EEEEE-A-K

'Cause what the fuck, this ain't Chanel, nigga, custom down?
Like, what the fuck, this ain't Burberry, custom brown?
He said, "Could you throw it back while you touch the ground?"
Then he said, "Do that pussy purr?" I said, "Yup, meow"
Hold up, fuck boys, ain't no need for you to roll up
Ain't no need for you to double tap neither, scroll up
Keep these bitches on they toes like Manolo
Be on the lookout when I come through, BOLO
Oh, whoa
Elegant bitch with a hoe glow
If it ain't big, then I won't blow
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe
Fuck is the tea? I just F'd a G
Make him say "Uhh", just ask Master P
Ball so hard, I just took a knee
Get me Rocky A$AP, nigga, word to RIH

Freak
F-f-freak
Some gyal a freak
Gyal a freak
Gyal a freak, freak, freak, freak

I can lick it, I can ride it
While you slippin' and slidin'
I can do all them little tricks and keep the dick up inside it
You can smack it, you can grip it
You can go down and kiss it
And every time he leave me 'lone, he always tell me he miss it
He want a F-R-EEEEE-A-K
F-R-EEEEE-A-K, A-K, A-K, A-K
EEEEE-A-K
F-R-EEEEE-A-K
