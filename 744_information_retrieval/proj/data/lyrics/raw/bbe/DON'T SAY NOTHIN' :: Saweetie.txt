Hello
Nothin', what's up?
Look at Twitter, for what?
What the fuck? (Say a thing)
These fuckin' big mouth-ass blogs
And big mouth-ass niggas, shut the fuck up (1500)

Don't you tell nobody we fuckin' (Shh)
Shut yo' mouf, nigga, don't say nothin'
Don't you tell nobody we fuckin' (That's right)
Shut yo' mouf, nigga, don't say nothin' (Don't you say a thing)
I'ma put this pussy in his mouf (In his mouf)
I'ma put this pussy in his mouf
Don't you tell nobody we fuckin' (That's right)
Shut yo' mouf, nigga, don't say nothin'

Why niggas always speakin' on who I'm fuckin' on?
He must've got excited when I FaceTimed with nothin' on
Them same lips that's yappin' be the same ones I nutted on
A hunnid K, please, you know how much paper I be touchin' on?
That's light, better check my net worth
Post a pic' in his sweatshirt, I bet it have my ex hurt
That's what I get for kissin' on these frogs
He got mad and told my business to the blogs
Nigga, pause, I'm appalled, need to chill out
Yeah, I pull up, then I bust, then I peel out
Said he was a boss but he talkin' like a groupie
I knew he wasn't ready for this pretty bitch coochie (Don't you say a thing)

Don't make me refund the dick
Send his ass back 'cause he came too quick
That shit wasn't bussin', I knew I shouldn't have fucked him

Something told me not to trust this nigga
Now my business in the streets, I should punch this nigga
That shit wasn't bussin', I knew I shouldn't have fucked him (Don't you say a thing)

But his vibe was so moist
Told him I wanna fuck him in a Rolls Royce
Sent over a car, I had no choice
Got to his estate and them gates opened up
Licked around my waist and my legs opened up
Can't lie, I was stuck for a second, he was givin' me that pressure
Like, this nigga might be special, he was doin' all the extras
I was lovin' how he thuggin', yeah, he pumpin' and he pumpin'
Aw, shit, this nigga cummin', yikes (Don't you say a thing)
