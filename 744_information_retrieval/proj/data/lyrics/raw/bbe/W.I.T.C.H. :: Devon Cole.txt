Rumor on the street is that her apples are delicious
The jury said she's charming but her exes say she's wicked
I swear to god I saw her howling at the sky
She ain't out to get you but she's better on your side

And she don't wanna be anybody else
She's a woman in total control of herself
It's such a wonder to be under her spell
What a woman, in total control of herself

Villainous kitty queen, she's got tricks up her sleeve
And I got a few up mine
She said, am I bad to the bone cause I get what I want
Mama said it ain't no crime

And she don't wanna be anybody else
She's a woman in total control of herself
It's such a wonder to be under her spell
What a woman, in total control of herself

La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la

Come out and play, it's fun in the dark
Tell me why you're so scared of a woman in charge
Baby don't run, you're breaking my heart
Tell me why you're so scared of a woman in charge

And she don't wanna be anybody else
She's a woman in total control of herself
It's such a wonder to be under her spell
What a woman, what a woman, woman, yeah

And she don't wanna be anybody else
She's a woman in total control of herself
It's such a wonder to be under her spell
What a woman, in total control of herself
