No gyal cyaan tell me 'bout my mother
Sixteen shot, we go longer than a ladder
Dem nuh fi talk 'bout di real Don Dada
Put body inna pot, dem ah bun like grabba
No bwoy cyaan diss me or my mother
Round here ain't safe, everybody need armour
Sixteen shot, we go shotta any bluddah
Rah-ta, rah-ta
Ka-kah, ka-kah, ka-kah
Rah-ka-ka-ka-ka-rah!

Yuh coulda be badda than a Kingstonee
Diss my mother then your skin start bleed
So don't bother mess with my mommy
With my mommy, with my mommy
Baby, tink yuh bad, say ya badder than she
If dog a-go bark, long time dem doh eat
Rap on, pop off, make ya move like freak
They say dem a gangsta, but so is mommy

They gon' put hands on a chick
They gon' put hands on her
Eyes watchin' when I comin' through the door
What I'ma do, they ain't prepared for

No gyal cyaan tell me 'bout my mother
Sixteen shot, we go longer than a ladder

Sixteen shot, we go shotta any bluddah

You gonna be madder than Bryant, Kobe
Diss my mother then your lip won't speak
So don't bother mess with my mommy
With my mommy, with my mommy
Jah really think you bad, say you badder than me
If things a-go start tonight, you won't sleep
Pop on, cut off, make ya look like creep
Dem say dem a bad gyal, but gyal dem nuh be

They gon' put hands on a chick
They gon' put hands on her
Eyes watchin' when I comin' through the door
What I'ma do, they ain't prepared for

No gyal can tell me 'bout my mother
Sixteen shot, we go longer than a ladder

Get one shot if dem tink dem a man
Get two shot if dem feel dem a don
Get three shot if dem tek mi fi eediat
Get four shot, this a copper shot, know that
