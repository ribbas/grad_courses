Baby I'm yours
Baby I'm yours

I know that you love me
Darlin' you don't have to say it
You know you can trust me
It's ok it's complicated

Nervous trip over my words
You're so pretty it hurts

Baby I'm yours
Baby I'm yours
Baby I'm yours

I need something more
I pray to the lord
But baby I'm yours

Is it too late to see you
I love the view of your headlights
Wanna get to know you
Park outside my house for the night

Nervous trip over my words
You're so pretty it hurts

Baby I'm yours
Baby I'm yours
Baby I'm yours

I need something more
I pray to the lord
But baby I'm yours

We're getting closer
Inches away
Lose composure
Favorite mistake
Friendship's over
Won't be the same

Baby I'm yours...
Baby I'm yours...
I need something more...
But baby I'm yours...

Baby I'm yours
Baby I'm yours
Baby I'm yours

I need something more
I pray to the lord
But baby I'm yours
