I swear I'm so saditty
I can't be approached
If that bitch hella basic, then that bitch gotta go

Huh, what's that in my cup? That's that potion
Rubbin' hundreds on my skin like it's lotion
Sitting courtside with my loc and
Presidential Rolly on me like I'm votin'
Smellin' like a rich bitch, I'm too potent
I don't do the nosebleeds, I want floor seats (Uh-huh)
I'm only fuckin' with a nigga that can coach me (Yeah)
I wasn't raised by IG but the OGs (OGs)

The Baccarat too trendy so I'm off it (Bitch, I'm off it)

The pretty girls gon' here this shit and start a mosh pit

Boss shit, know you need a boss chick (Boss chick)

Long nails, only get the tall tips (Tall tips)
That ain't MAC, girl, that's icy on my lips (Mwah)
Boss shit, know you need a boss chick (Big boss)
Real niggas gon' pay what it cost quick (Spend it)
Long nails, only get the tall tips (Bling-bling)
That ain't MAC, girl, that's icy on my lips

I ain't goin' nowhere, just embrace me, bitch
Always lurkin' on my page, you don't hate me, sis (That's right)
I ain't botherin' nobody, I just breathe and shit
Deep down in your heart, you wanna be like this
No, ho, we don't give a fuck about those like I'm D'Lo
Pretty Filipino from the Bay like I'm P-Lo, we know
Your pockets ain't bigger than your ego
I need a rich nigga like dinero in casino

Real niggas gon' pay what it cost quick (Make it quick)
