Hello
It's popping, it's popping,

I gotta ask 'em, 'cause if I don't
It's popping, it's popping,

Let's go!

And all the boys keep stopping

Mac Mac L'Oreal yep 'cause I'm worth it
Love the way I put it on so perfect
Wipe the corners of my mouth so I work it
When I walk down the hallway they can't say nothing

My lips so luscious
The way I spice it up with the Mac Mac brushes
L'Oreal got the most watermelon crushes
That's probably the reason all these boys got crushes.

My lips still rock
Lil Mama melon with the hot pink top
Cherry, vanilla, flavors is a virtue
They loving, lip gloss universal

They rolling they eyes, they lip gloss cheap
It ain't my fault but I gotta upgrade ya

No music
Who you know spit it hard to a hand clap
She ain't whack so I tell a corny nigga hand that.
To a record label while I get my hair wrapped
Then I let it fall under my New York Yankee cap.

Anybody that know better that got cheddar bet go get it
'Cause y'all already know I'm where it's at.
And if I'm rolling I'm riding I got my homies beside me
I tell Ben, "Drop me off," and he like "Where it's at?".

I get to popping I'm dropping y'all know I don't play. Y'all know my swag is official for what my flo say.
And any club, if it's popping, my record gon' play.
Rest in Peace to Hazel, Lil Zay Zay
No music

Sittin' in 8th period
Thought I was in trouble
Dean called me on the loudspeaker on the double
I stepped in her office like "Yes Ms. McClarkson?"
She like "Girl, ran out of my lip gloss and
Write down where you get yours from
'Cause I must admit
That bubblegum is popping, is popping is popping."
She ain't fronting
And I be loving it
I be I be loving it and
I be using it I be I be using it and
I be rubbing it I be I be rubbing it on my lips
My lips my lip gloss
