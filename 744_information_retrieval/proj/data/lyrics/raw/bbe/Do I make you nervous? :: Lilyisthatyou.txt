Oh-oh, oh-oh
Lily, is that you?

Snowflakes on my body
You don't want love, you just wanna party
Ride him like Harley
I don't want love, fuck me like a Barbie
Oh, yeah, I want it, you know I want it
I know I want it, that supersonic
You make me nervous
Six in the mornin', sex in the mornin'
You know I want it

Do I make you nervous? (I hope that I do)
Do I make you nervous? (I know that I do)
Lily, is that you?

'Cause I'm a bad bitch, don't wanna need no man
I'm a bad bitch, don't wanna need no man
But I'm drinkin' out his hand like a vodka cran
'Cause the dick so good, I gotta get it again
I'm a bad bitch, don't wanna need no man
I'm a bad bitch, don't wanna need no man
But I'm drinkin' out his hand like a vodka cran
'Cause the dick so good, I gotta get it again

You can crawl, for your ball, don't you get emotional
Too involved, want it all
I don't text, you know I call (Hello)
Hate that you're still in my head, hate that I slept in your bed
Hate that I want it again but oh, nah, nah, nah
I wish we didn't get high, I wish that you didn't cry
I know you're fucked up inside but oh, nah, nah, nah
Oh, nah, nah, nah

Do I make you nervous? (I hope that I do)
Do I make you nervous? (I know that I do)
Lily, is that you?

'Cause I'm a bad bitch, don't wanna need no man
I'm a bad bitch, don't wanna need no man
But I'm drinkin' out his hand like a vodka cran
'Cause the dick so good, I gotta get it again
I'm a bad bitch, don't wanna need no man
I'm a bad bitch, don't wanna need no man
But I'm drinkin' out his hand like a vodka cran
'Cause the dick so good, I gotta get it again

Again and again
Kick another psycho out of my bed
Again and again
Dick was were pretty good but it ain't worth my head
Does that make you horny
Just to fuck me then avoid me
Fuck then avoid me, fuck then avoid me

Hahaha, hahaha
Girls, if you're listening, protect your peace and block him
Block him
Ha, haha
