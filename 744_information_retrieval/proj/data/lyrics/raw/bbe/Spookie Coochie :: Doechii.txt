Trick or treat! (Shut the fuck up!)
Goddamn it!
Back the fuck up from my door, what the fuck is you supposed to be, a tampon?
Bitch, trick
Trick, trick this trick, trick

It's D-O-E
Reppin' for the B-A-Ps
Comin' for the T-O-P
Like another J-O-B
Nigga, I'm back like a Chucky bride from the afterlife
Nothin' nice, this a Antichrist, this a bloody knife
Bloody ride, he gon' fantasise 'bout the cellulite
In my thighs, got a spooky [?] Twat?, for your appetite (Yummy, yummy, yummy)
Turn him on when I'm all alone, we be moanin' (Ooh, uh, ooh, uh)
He call my phone, I'ma fit this pussy with a drone in (Ooh, uh, ooh, uh)
He wanna own it, he pay to get this pussy flown in (Ooh, uh, ooh, uh)
He wanna clone it, but I'ma have this nigga foamin' (Ooh, uh, ooh, uh)

And this the Wizard of Oz, I'm Wicked Witch of the West (West, West, West)
You [?] fillin' up cards, I'm at the top of the deck (Deck, deck, deck)
I know that I pose a threat when I posted up on the net
If you book with Doechii.com, you know you bookin' the best

[?] (Ah, ah)
Do this with no magic, ah (Ah, ah)
Kill you with no casket, ah (Ah, ah)
Mwahaha, no Dracula (Ah, ah)

Chop you up, no hatchet, ah (Ah, ah)
Soak you in that acid tub, ah (Ah)
Feed you to the maggots ah (Ah, ah)

You know we be wailing, wailing, wailing
You know we get violent, violent, violent
You don't wanna try this, try this, try this
You know we be wailing, wailing, wailing

You know we be wailing, wailing, wailing
You know we get violent, violent, violent
You don't wanna try this, try this, try this
You know we be wailing, wailing, wailing

By the time you hear this, I'll have taken on another form
The way I've been snapping, y'all gon' end up my children of the corn
I think I've adapted to all of the cannibal savages
I feel a possession in this session, I need a Catholic
To assess it, come and bless it and undress it
Pussy precious, she a fetish
[?], Armageddon
I won't eat it, I'mma get it
He don't get it, he regret it
Coochie vegan, it's a veggie
Come and eat this coochie dressing
I am Doechii, I am legend
Don't shoot me, just get the message
You got beep them bitches dressing
UPS it, I'm too young to beat this [?]
Eat you bitches, shit you out through my fucking large intestine
I spit bars that make you quit, I insist that you respect it
Say your music keep it close, I suggest that you protect it
When I'm in the studio I go Jason, I go Freddy
Slice you bitches in your bedding
Shoot your mammy and your daddy
At your wedding, I been waitin', I been ready
This a pill like [?]
I go up like PMS, you still rap like PBS
Work them checks like BTS
Hatin' for a [?]
I don't contemplate or flex
When I rap, I step on necks
My bars feel like S-E-X, they book me like SOS
I told 'em once, I told 'em once, I guess I'll tell 'em twice
Another one, another one, I'm in it for the ride
Ayy, fuck the fame and fuck them hoes, I do it for the vibe
They want me dead but I still do it in another life
