Ooh-wah-ooh-wah-ooh-wah-ooh
Ain't got nothing left to prove
Man, I'm finally free
Damn it feels good to be me

You're only shining
When you act yourself
Wish I coulda learned that
Before I went through hell
Lord I was trying
To flip the cards I was dealt
I was tired of hiding
I had some words with myself

I said stop
Tryna be the things that I'm not
Tryna be like everyone else
Tryna fit inside of that box
Oh-oh, you got
Magic inside of your heart
Had it right from the start
Copycatting's dirty
Nothing worse than being thirsty

Ooh-wah-ooh-wah-ooh-wah-ooh
I'm no good at being you
My philosophy
Damn it feels good to be me
Ooh-wah-ooh-wah-ooh-wah-ooh
Ain't got nothing left to prove
Man, I'm finally free
Damn it feels good to be me

Damn it feels good to be me

You don't start living
Till you kill that shade
So I won't listen
To the hate parade
I know that I'm not
Everyone's cup of tea
Some people spit me right out now
When they ask me to leave

That's when I stop
Tryna be the things that I'm not
Tryna be like everyone else
Tryna fit inside of that box
Oh-oh, you got
Magic inside of your heart
Had it right from the start
Copycatting's dirty
Nothing worse than being thirsty

Ooh-wah-ooh-wah-ooh-wah-ooh
I'm no good at being you
My philosophy
Damn it feels good to be me
Ooh-wah-ooh-wah-ooh-wah-ooh
Ain't got nothing left to prove
Man, I'm finally free
Damn it feels good to be me

Damn it feels good to be me
Damn it feels good to be me
Damn it feels good to be
