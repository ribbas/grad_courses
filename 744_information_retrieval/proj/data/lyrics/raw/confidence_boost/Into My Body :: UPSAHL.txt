(I wanna get)

I don't recognize the girl that I see
On the screen looking mean, uh
I don't wanna call my friends
So I'm home being lonely instead, uh

What if I can't be loved?
What if I'm not enough?
Kicking myself when I get down
What if I can't get up?
What if I'm always stuck?
And who can I ever trust?
Spiral again out of my head, I

I wanna get into my body
And let my skin do the talking
I wanna feel like I'm myself again
I wanna get into my body
I don't need anyone on me
Just serotonin rushing to my head
(I wanna get)

I don't wanna open up to anyone
'Cause if I do, they might run, yeah
And I won't waste another night
And tell a lie, and say, "Thanks, that was fun"
I, I, I

I wanna get into my body
And let my skin do the talking
I wanna feel like I'm myself again (Myself again)
I wanna get into my body
I don't need anyone on me
Just serotonin rushing to my head, I

(I wanna get)
Into my body, body, body
(I wanna get)
Into my body, body, body (And out of my head)
(I wanna get)
Into my body, body, body
(I wanna get)
Into my body, body, body

I wanna get into my body
And let my skin do the talking
I wanna feel like I'm myself again
I wanna get into my body
I don't need anyone on me
Just serotonin rushing to my head, I, I

Get into my body and out of my head
(I wanna get, I wanna get, I wanna get)
Can't stop a train wreck, I'll get off instead

I wanna get into my body
And let my skin do the talking
I wanna feel like I'm myself again

(I wanna get)
Into my body, body, body
(I wanna get)
Into my body, body, body (And out of my head)
(I wanna get)
Into my body, body, body
(I wanna get)
Into my body, body, body
