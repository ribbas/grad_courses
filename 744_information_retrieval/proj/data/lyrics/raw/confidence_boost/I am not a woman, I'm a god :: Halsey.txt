(I am not a woman, I'm a God)
(I am not a martyr, I'm a problem)
(I am not a legend, I'm a fraud)
(Keep your heart, 'cause I already)

Everyday I've got a smile where my frown goes
A couple bodies in the garden where the grass grows
I take 'em with me to the grave in a suitcase
Maybe I could be a different human in a new place

Oh
I just wanna feel something, tell me where to go
'Cause everybody knows something I don't wanna know
So I'll stay right here 'cause I'm better all alone
Yeah I'm better all alone

I am not a woman, I'm a God
I am not a martyr, I'm a problem
I am not a legend, I'm a fraud
So keep your heart, 'cause I already got one

I am not a woman, I'm a God
I am not a martyr, I'm a problem
I am not a legend, I'm a fraud
Keep your heart, 'cause I already

Every morning, got a hollow where my heart goes
I never listen but I see it with my eyes closed
I know you, I remember from the grass stain
Maybe I could be a better human with a new name

Oh
I just wanna feel something, tell me where to go
'Cause everybody knows something I don't wanna know
So I'll stay right here cause I'm better all alone
Yeah, I'm better all alone

I am not a woman, I'm a God
I am not a martyr, I'm a problem
I am not a legend, I'm a fraud
So keep your heart, 'cause I already got one

I am not a woman, I'm a God
I am not a martyr, I'm a problem
I am not a legend, I'm a fraud
Keep your heart, 'cause I already

I'm ready to leave it
I'll go when I feel it
Got caught both hands on the smoking gun
I try but I need it
It's hard but I feel it
And it really does hurt when you love someone

Oh
I just wanna feel something, tell me where to go
'Cause everybody knows something I don't wanna know
So I'll stay right here 'cause I'm better all alone
Yeah, I'm better all alone

I am not a woman, I'm a God
I am not a martyr, I'm a problem
I am not a legend, I'm a fraud
So keep your heart, 'cause I already got one

I am not a woman, I'm a God
I am not a martyr, I'm a problem
I am not a legend, I'm a fraud
Keep your heart, 'cause I already got one
