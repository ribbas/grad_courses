So here we are, the brokenhearted
Crowding the bar, dance in the dark
Just getting started
Hookups and games
They're all so shameless
They're all the same
Just different names
Guess I love the heartless
Yeah I swear it's not my fault
Tell me why I always fall, oh in and out love so easily
Don't know why I even try when I fucking hate goodbyes
Pour a drink and let me drown the memories

So Give me one shot for every time they said I love you
And give me two for the times they turn their back
Then give me three shots for everyone that's been there before
And give me one more
Cause we're the best they ever had

I might be a fool
And I Won't deny it
I always rush in play house again
Leave me blindsided
It starts out so sweet
But the feeling is fleeting
Under the sheets
Head over feet
Rinse and repeat it
Yeah I swear it's not my fault
Tell me why I always fall, oh in and out love so easily
Don't know why I even try when I fucking hate goodbyes
Pour a drink and let me drown the memories

So Give me one shot for every time they said I love you
And give me two for the times they turn their back
Then give me three shots for everyone that's been there before
And give me one more
Cause we're the best they ever had

So Give me one shot for every time they said I love you
And give me two for the times they turn their back
Then give me three shots for everyone that's been there before
And give me one more
(One More One More)
And give me one more
(One More)
Cause we're the best they ever had
