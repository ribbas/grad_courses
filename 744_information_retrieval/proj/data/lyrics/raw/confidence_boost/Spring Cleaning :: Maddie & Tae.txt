I used to let you call me up in the middle of the night
You said your bed was getting cold and I lit your fire
Your steadiness was seldom wearing out your welcome
Ain't a smile and wave with this goodbye

So, I'mma say, thank you, and let you go
Guess I took a little note from Marie Kondo

Ooh, you're taking up space
It's time to tidy up and take you out my brain
Ooh, what do you see
Cleaning out the closet looks good on me
It ain't spring, but I'm cleaning house
It ain't spring, but I'm cleaning out
It ain't spring, but I'm cleaning house
So, come and get your shit out

Yeah, I dropped you like a habit and your unclaimed baggage
You can find it in the trash with the old me
Yeah, I'm feeling like a queen in my king-sized bed
Now I know what minimal finally means

Ooh, you're taking up space
It's time to tidy up and take you out my brain
Ooh, what do you see
Cleaning out the closet looks good on me
It ain't spring, but I'm cleaning house
It ain't spring, but I'm cleaning out
It ain't spring, but I'm cleaning house
So, come and get your shit out

You shoulda never let me watch that show
'Cause I took a couple notes from Marie Kondo

Ooh, you're taking up space
It's time to tidy up and take you out my brain
Ooh, what do you see
Cleaning out the closet looks good on me
It ain't spring, but I'm cleaning house
It ain't spring, but I'm cleaning out
It ain't spring, but I'm cleaning house
It ain't spring, but I'm cleaning out
It ain't spring, but I'm cleaning house
It ain't spring, but I'm cleaning out
It ain't spring, but I'm cleaning house
So, come and get your shit
