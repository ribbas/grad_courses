You don't know me, you don't get it
You really sold me, but you never met me halfway
'Cause you don't see it, where this train's headed
But best believe me, you're not gonna get in my way

Does it help you sleep?
Does it make you stronger
To beat up on me?
I can't take it any longer

I won't stop running down that road
I'll keep dancing 'til I die
You can blow out my candle
But you'll never put out my fire
So don't stop, I've been here and I know
You can't quit, even when it hurts to try
You can blow out my candle
But you'll never put out my fire

And you don't know me, you don't understand it
I'm not the old me, crying in the ballroom backstage
Look up and see it, where this plane's headed
That bird you let go, is never getting back in that cage

Did it help you sleep?
Did it make you stronger
Beating up on me?
I won't take it any longer

I won't stop running down that road
I'll keep dancing 'til I die
You can blow out my candle
But you'll never put out my fire
So don't stop, I've been here and I know
You can't quit, even when it hurts to try
You can blow out my candle
But you'll never put out

My fire, I'm up in smoke
Soft tires, pump that choke (Come on)
Who's gonna feed the flame?
Who's gonna feed the flame?
Like moonlight you fade away
Forget me, forget my face
But you'll never forget my name
Don't ever forget my name

'Cause I won't stop running down that road
I'll keep dancing 'til I die
You can blow out my candle
But you'll never put out my fire
I won't stop, I've been here and I know
You can't quit, even when it hurts to try
You can blow out my candle
But you'll never put out my fire

I won't stop running down that road
I'll keep dancing 'til I die
You can blow out my candle
But you'll never put out my fire
(But you'll never put out my fire)
