Somedays I wake up and I think
I could take anything they throw at me
Somedays I wake up
And I just want to go right back to sleep
And there's so much pressure
Be smart, be cute, be nice, be better
Well I'm just trying to be me

The whole world has an opinion
On everything I do and how I feel
I can't keep up with it
I'm sick of trying to figure it out
Like I said there's pressure
Be cool, be quick, do it all, be better
What does that even mean?

There's a girl in the mirror
And she's not what you tell her
She's a lot that you'll never even see
And she's made a decision
Cause she doesn't have to fit in
She's not perfect she's just human like me

My skin is tough but I am soft underneath
Imperfect but perfectly me
These are the flaws that I live in
I was freaking out but I'm feeling
I wouldn't want to be anywhere else

My skin is tough but I am soft underneath
Imperfect but perfectly me
These are the flaws that I live in
I was freaking out but I'm feeling
I wouldn't want to be anywhere else
(wouldn't want to be anywhere else)

The road ahead is still unclear
It hasn't been easy to get here
I lost sight of who I am
But now I know I'm enough

But there's so much pressure
Be smart, be cute, be nice, be better
Things can get pretty tough

There's a girl in the mirror
And she's not what you tell her

She's not perfect she's just human like me

My skin is tough but I am soft underneath
Imperfect but perfectly me
These are the flaws that I live in
I was freaking out but I'm feeling
I wouldn't want to be anywhere else
