Resilient little thing
Just like mama made you
No one needs to save you
A-na-na, a-na-na, a-na-na
Wildflower in the spring
No, they can't contain you
Through the cracks you break through
A-na-na, a-na-na, a-na-na

I deserve congratulations
'Cause I came out the other side
I've been having revelations
And I'm gonna let them shine
I deserve congratulations
I never thought that I'd survive
If you tell me I won't make it
That's when I, that's when I

Resilient little thing
Just like mama raised you
So you've got that
Wildfire in your soul
Don't you ever let it go
Make it burn so bright
That they all know

I deserve congratulations
'Cause I came out the other side
I've been having revelations
And I'm gonna let them shine
I deserve congratulations
I never thought that I'd survive
If you tell me I won't make it
That's when I, that's when I

Never rained in the desert, till I
Picked me for the very first time
It's darkest before the sunrise
That's when I
