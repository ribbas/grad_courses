I'ma need those eyes focusing on me
Middle of the night, I'm the only star you'll see
I'ma need those hands runnin' over me
'Cause I ain't the type to let you go easy, so

Say goodbye to every other girl in the night behind you
Now you're mine, tell me what you're willing to sacrifice, ooh

Sacrifice
When it comes to me, don't want no compromise
This should be the only body on your mind
When it comes to me, I'm down for life
So tell me, would you sacrifice?

Yeah
Sacrifice
Tell me, would you sacrifice?
Yeah
Sacrifice
Tell me, would you sacrifice?

Wanna be the air every time you breathe
Running through your veins and the spaces in between
I wanna feel your heart every time it bleeds
Living in your brain, there's only room for me, so

Say goodbye to every other girl in the night behind you
Now you're mine, tell me what you're willing to sacrifice, ooh

Sacrifice
When it comes to me, don't want no compromise
This should be the only body on your mind
When it comes to me, I'm down for life
So tell me, would you sacrifice?

Yeah
Sacrifice
Tell me, would you sacrifice?
Yeah
Sacrifice
Tell me, would you sacrifice?

Sacrifice your body to the rhythm of mine
To the rhythm, to the rhythm of mine
Sacrifice your body to the rhythm of mine
To the rhythm, to the rhythm of mine

Sacrifice your body to the rhythm of mine
To the rhythm, to the rhythm of mine
Sacrifice your body to the rhythm of mine
So tell me, would you sacrifice?
