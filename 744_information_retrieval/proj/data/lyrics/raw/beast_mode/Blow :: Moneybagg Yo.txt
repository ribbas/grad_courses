Federal, federal, federal, fed
A'ight, you already know how I play it
Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, go

Blow a lot of money on dope, blow a lot of money on clothes (Federal, ayy)
Blow a lot of money on guns, spend a lil' money on hoes (Uh, uh)
Blow a lot of money on diamonds, the main reason why I be shinin' (Ice on ice)
Lost a lot of money in the trap, then got it back off rappin' (Rappin'-ass nigga)
Fuckin' off money on in the hood, in the dice game, what they hit fo' (Shoot some, bet some)
Blow a lot of money on rent, I ain't even seen my condo (It's been so long)
Blow a lot of money on opps, I'm tryna put 'em in a fronto (I'm tryna smoke 'em)
Talk about money all the time, I can't change the convo'

Eight hunnid a zip for my jacket and shoes (Ooh)
Go make a serve and jump back in the booth (Go)
New car smell, the Ferrari a couple (Vroom)
Just enough room to fit me and ya boo (Fool)
Hard to sort out all the real and the fake
Gotta look at this shit for what it is
They know I drip, I'ma come through and kill
Put that shit on splash when I spill
Crime scene, murder, murder, all my losses served a purpose (Facts)
Grape vine sippin' purple (Wock'), hit it right, she a squirter
Paid all that money for a car with no backseat, nallin' hard as a athlete
I can't let up on 'em, man, I gotta keep in they face like acne
I'm back to back like everyday, you caught a body but gave up a statement
Yo gangsta don't matter no more, ya gangsta don't matter no more, no more
Yo gangsta don't matter no more (No more), she went and told one of my other ones
That's why I cut off the hoe (Be gone), that's why I'on't fuck with the hoe no more
That why I'on't fuck with the hoe (She blew it)

Blow a lot of money on dope, blow a lot of money on clothes (Federal, ayy)
Blow a lot of money on guns, spend a lil' money on hoes (Uh, uh)
Blow a lot of money on diamonds, the main reason why I be shinin' (Ice on ice)
Lost a lot of money in the trap, then got it back off rappin' (Rappin'-ass nigga)

Blow a lot of money on opps, I'm tryna put 'em in a fronto (I'm tryna smoke 'em)
Talk about money all the time, I can't change the convo'

Chase these Ms, can't get no Zs, hustle like it's two of me (Bagg)
Flip my backend, ninety Gs, smart investment, fifty Ps
I let lil' bro roll my weed, we just pour the one-two-threes
I just put deuces in my juices, like pink stain on my white tees (Syrup)
Jumped in the game with some confidence (What happened?)
Now when you look up, I'm runnin' it (See)
Before the label pulled up, had a buzz and a plug
Pay what you weigh, I ain't frontin' it (Nope)
Real trendsetter, I'on't steal style
And I'm everywhere like a iCloud
She gon' get 'round when I'm in town
At the penthouse gettin' pinned down (In that yami, go)

Blow a lot of money on dope, blow a lot of money on clothes (Federal, ayy)
Blow a lot of money on guns, spend a lil' money on hoes (Uh, uh)
Blow a lot of money on diamonds, the main reason why I be shinin' (Ice on ice)
