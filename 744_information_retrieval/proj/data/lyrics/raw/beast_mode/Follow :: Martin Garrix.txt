Follow me into the unknown
See what happens if you let go
Don't you know only you can set you free
Who knows where this moment will lead
Even if you're afraid, I know
You're exactly where you're supposed to be
Whenever it starts
Whatever you see
Wherever you are
You're exactly where you're supposed to be

You're exactly where you're supposed to be
