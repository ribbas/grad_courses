Yeah, ah, get it
Yeah, ah, get it
Yeah, yeah, ah, get it
Yeah, ah, get it
Yeah, ah, get it
Yeah

(You ain't nothing but a)
Dog, player, ah, get it
Fraud, player, ah, get it
I understand, I understand
You ain't the man, you ain't a man
(You ain't nothing but a)
Hound dog, hound dog, hound dog
(You ain't nothing but a)

Player getting valeted around in that ho whip
Two fingers up, one down with my toes ten
Flewed out with my boobs out, put a cork in it
Love it when you be cryin' out when I'm corseted
I don't think he gon' make it
Do not let me start ragin'
Bitch, I'm losin' my patience
This ain't stayin' in Vegas (You ain't nothing but a)

There's more sides to the story, I'ma tell everybody
Had your ass sittin' courtside with your arm around me
Had your ass sittin' first class with your burnt ass out in Abu Dhabi
Could've been what we should've been but you lost a bet, now you gotta find me
Find a seat, nigga
I ain't playin' this hide and seek
High school when you finally peaked
Hound dog, come find a treat
I'm a bad bitch but (You ain't nothing but a)

Dog, player, ah, get it
Fraud, player, ah, get it
I understand, I understand
You ain't the man, you ain't a man
(You ain't nothing but a)
Hound dog, hound dog, hound dog

Yeah, yeah, I said (You ain't nothing but a)
I get it, I know you got some other shit you wanted
I get it, you needed someone that could prove you wrong
So I reckon, you leave all of your problems at the door to my city
You gon' need to tell my brothers where you from
And I admit it, I still got empathy
And you gon' feel it for two weeks
When I release you in them sheets (You ain't nothing but a)
And keep my meaning discreet
Keep the clean in my Jeep
And put that Yeezy in your teeth
Let my demons off their leashes
If you even think to speak
I'ma give a whole new meaning
When you said you live in a dream
We can keep that shit asleep
And you gon' laugh with all your Gs
Countin' them sheep, sheep, sheep
Talkin' 'bout Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z, R-I-P

(You ain't nothing but a)
Dog, player, ah, get it
Fraud, player, ah, get it
I understand, I understand
You ain't the man, you ain't a man
(You ain't nothing but a)
Hound dog, hound dog, hound dog

(You ain't nothing but a)
Dog, player, ah, get it
Fraud, player, ah, get it
I understand, I understand
You ain't the man, you ain't a man
(You ain't nothing but a)
Hound dog, hound dog, hound dog

You ain't nothing but a
Yeah, ah, get it
Yeah, ah, get it
Yeah, yeah, ah, get it
Yeah, ah, get it
Yeah, yeah, ah, get it
Yeah, you ain't nothing but a
