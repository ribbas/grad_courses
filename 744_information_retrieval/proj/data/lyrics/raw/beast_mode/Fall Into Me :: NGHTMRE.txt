So baby, won't you fall?
So baby, won't you fall?

Oh-oh-oh, can't you see I'm lonely, babe?
Caught up in my own misery
And I can't even say your name
Without letting it haunt me
If I go another night
I don't know if I'll survive
You told me that you needed space
So baby, won't you fall into me?

(Fall into me)
(Fall into me)
(Fall into me)
Baby, won't you fall into me?

Fall, fall into me
Baby, won't you fall? (Fall)

If I go another night
I don't know if I'll survive
You told me that you needed space
Baby, won't you fall into me?

Into me, into me
Fall, fall into me
Into me, into me

If I have to crawl
There would be bruises
Oh, I'd risk it all
Just to get through this
And I know that I'm not perfect, baby
But I promise I'm tryin'

Can't you see I'm lonely, babe?
Caught up in my own misery
And I can't even say your name
Without letting it haunt me
If I go another night
I don't know if I'll survive
You told me that you needed space
So, baby, won't you fall into me?

(Fall into me)
(Fall into me)
(Fall into me)
Baby, won't you fall into me?

Fall into me
Baby, won't you fall? (Fall)

If I go another night
I don't know if I'll survive
You told me that you needed space
So, baby, won't you fall into me?
(Baby, won't you fall into me?)
