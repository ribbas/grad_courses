(Off of my mind, off of my mind, off of my mind, yeah
Off of my mind, off of my mind, off of my mind, yeah)

We don't have control
No, we're just powerless tonight
No-no, our egos are letting go
Into a thousand little lies

Yeah, I get reckless when you put your hands on my body
Go crazy for that touch, your arms wrapped around me
There's nothing in this world right now that could stop me
You say your heart is mine
But where's your mi-mi-mind?

Can't stop thinking about the way your body moves
Bad thoughts taking me down, there's nothing I can do
Can't stop thinking about the way your body moves
Get off of my mind, I got nothing left to lose

Off of my mind, off of my mind, off of my mind, yeah
Off of my mind, off of my mind, off of my mind, yeah
Off of my mind, off of my mind, off of my mind, yeah
Get off of my mind, I got nothing left to lose, yeah

Off of my mind, off of my mind, off of my mind, yeah
Off of my mind, off of my mind, off of my mind, yeah
Off of my mind, off of my mind, off of my mind, yeah
Get off of my mind, I got nothing left to lose, yeah

I hope
We don't push it past the point of no return
No-now, so close
To the fire I can feel the way it burns

Yeah, I get reckless when you put your hands on my body
Go crazy for that touch, your arms wrapped around me
There's nothing in this world right now that could stop me
You say your heart is mine
But where's your mi-mi-mind?

Can't stop thinking about the way your body moves
Bad thoughts taking me down, there's nothing I can do
Can't stop thinking about the way your body moves
Get off of my mind, I got nothing left to lose, yeah

Off of my mind, off of my mind, off of my mind, yeah
Off of my mind, off of my mind, off of my mind, yeah
Off of my mind, off of my mind, off of my mind, yeah
Get off of my mind, I got nothing left to lose, yeah

Can't stop thinking about the way your body moves
Bad thoughts taking me down, there's nothing I can do
Can't stop thinking about the way your body moves
Get off of my mind, I got nothing left to lose, yeah
