Never sell out
Find my way out
In my own lane
Won't play the game
I am by myself
I'm all alone
I think too much
Need to switch off

Fuck you, love you
Hate you, want you
Fuck you, love you
Hate you, want you

Roll up, eyes down
Not mad, just down
I want the best
Right now, a test
I want something
More than nothing
More than this time
Time to define

Fuck you, love you
Hate you, want you
Fuck you, love you
Hate you, want you

(Want you)

Fuck you, love you
Hate you, want you
Fuck you, love you
Hate you, want you

(I don't wanna)

(I don't wanna)
