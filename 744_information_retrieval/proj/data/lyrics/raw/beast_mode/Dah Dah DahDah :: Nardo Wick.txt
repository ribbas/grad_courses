I'ma brick, baby boy, concrete, lil' nigga
Yeah, I rap on all that shit, I'm still a street lil' nigga (Grrah, grrah, grrah, grrah)
Got more shots than a gym, you wanna beef, lil' nigga?
I'm who all the hoes like, they wanna be me nigga (Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)
Diamonds look just like the static on the TV, nigga
We ain't cuffin' hoes, I play her like a CD, nigga
Pull up, eight contents, you can't see me, nigga
Shot his ass, then he screamed, "Oh, ooh, wee", nigga

If there's problems, we gon' solve 'em
Got a lot of weapons for the drama
Try to understand me, please don't judge me
If you ain't ever seen a body

Pull up with my Glock out
If the opps out, I'ma rock out
Fat mouth, tryna fat mouth to a shot mouth
Dead man, he a dead man for what he said, man
He seen me, I ain't seen him, he turned to the gingerbread man
(Run, run, as fast you can)
(You can't catch me, I'm the gingerbread man)

All them niggas 'round you bitches, so how the fuck you gangsta?
Niggas shot and hit the fences, so how the fuck you aimin'?
Nigga ain't killed nobody, how the fuck you bangin'?
All these niggas be cap, they not really like that
Wrote that hoe when I was broke, now she wanna write back
Want me to put it in her throat, want my tip to touch the back
She wanna be my wicked witch, she keep askin' for my strap
If there's problems, we gon' solve 'em
Got a lot of weapons for the drama
I'm talkin' 'bout them FNs, Glock 19s and SK
Wicked wild man, somebody tell 'em stop, he on a rampage
Batman, he always in the same color batman
If we slide and you get hit but you don't die, you better act then

If there's problems, we gon' solve 'em
Got a lot of weapons for the drama
Try to understand me, please don't judge me
If you ain't ever seen a body
