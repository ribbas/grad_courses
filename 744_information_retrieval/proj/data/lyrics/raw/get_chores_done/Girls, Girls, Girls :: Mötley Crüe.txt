Friday night and I need a fight
My motorcycle and a switchblade knife
Handful of grease in my hair feels right
But what I need to make me tight are those

Girls, Girls, Girls
Long legs and burgundy lips
Girls, Girls, Girls
Dancin' down on the Sunset Strip
Girls, Girls, Girls
Red lips, fingertips

Trick or treat-sweet to eat
On Halloween and New Year's Eve
Yankee girls, ya just can't be beat
But they're the best when they're off their feet

Girls, Girls, Girls
At the Dollhouse in Ft. Lauderdale
Girls, Girls, Girls
Rocking in Atlanta at Tattletails
Girls, Girls, Girls
Raising Hell at the 7th Veil
Have you read the news
In the Soho Tribune
Ya know she did me
Well then she broke my heart

I'm such a good, good boy
I just need a new toy
I tell ya what, girl
Dance for me, I'll keep you over-employed
Just tell me a story
You know the one I mean

Crazy Horse, Paris, France
Forgot the names, remember romance
I got the photos, a menage a trois
Musta broke those Frenchies laws with those

Girls, Girls, Girls
Ba-ba-Body Shop
And Marble Arch
Girls, Girls, Girls
Tropicana's where I lost my heart

Girls, Girls, Girls

Hey Tommy, check that out man!
What, Vince where?
Hey, right there!
Hey! [whistles]
Hey baby, don't you wanna go somewhere? [wolf whistles]

Girls, Girls, Girls

Girls, Girls, Girls

Girls, Girls, Girls

Girls, Girls, Girls

Girls, Girls, Girls

Whoo!
