Oh wow, man that's aâ€”
Wait a second man
What do you think the teacher's gonna look like this year?
My butt, man

T-t-teacher stop that screaming
Teacher don't you see?
Don't wanna be no uptown fool

Maybe I should go to hell
But I am doin' well
Teacher needs to see me after school

I think of all the education that I missed
But then my homework was never quite like this

Got it bad, got it bad, got it bad
I'm hot for teacher
I got it bad, so bad
I'm hot for teacher

Hey, I heard you missed us, we're back
I brought my pencil
Gimme something to write on, man

I heard about your lessons
But lessons are so cold
I know about this school

Little girl from Cherry Lawn
How can you be so bold?
How did you know that golden rule?

I think of all the education that I've missed
But then my homework was never quite like this!

Got it bad, got it bad, got it bad
I'm hot for teacher
I got it bad, so bad
I'm hot for teacher

Oh man, I think that clock is slow
I don't feel tardy
Class dismissed

I got it bad, got it bad, got it bad
I'm hot for teacher
Yes I'm hot

Oh my god
