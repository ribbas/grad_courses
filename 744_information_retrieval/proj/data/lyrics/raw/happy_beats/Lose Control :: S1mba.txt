Nothing good goes down after the sky turns black
And when my demons out you know I can't go back
You got a smile of gold, you wanna take my soul
But when the lights go low you know I lose control

You know I lose control
Lose control
You know I lose control
But when the lights go low you know I lose control

What's the deal, 'cause you stalling, I'm all in
You in your feelings, you down, got you calling
I feel you breathing, your body, you winding on me
Said you feeling you want it, you falling for me

Nothing good goes down after the sky turns black
And when my demons out you know I can't go back
You got a smile of gold, you wanna take my soul
But when the lights go low you know I lose control

You know I lose control
Lose control
You know I lose control
But when the lights go low you know I lose control

What's the deal, 'cause you stalling, I'm all in
You in your feelings, you down, got you calling
I feel you breathing, your body, you winding on me
Said you feeling you want it, you falling for me

Hot sweat, tight dress, body fire, SOS
Hot sweat, bunda check, body fire, SOS
Hot sweat, tight dress, body fire, SOS
Hot sweat, bunda check, body fire, SOS

Nothing good goes down after the sky turns black
And when my demons out you know I can't go back
You got a smile of gold, you wanna take my soul
But when the lights go low you know I lose control

You know I lose control
Lose control
You know I lose control
But when the lights go low you know I lose control
Yeah
