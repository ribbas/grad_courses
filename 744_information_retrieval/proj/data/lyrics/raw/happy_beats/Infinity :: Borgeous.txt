I read your mind
And you know mine
We fill up the space between you and I
We're losing time
Can we rewind
I don't wanna hear the goodbyes

Oooh
I'll never give up
No I'll never give up on you
Can we put forever on loop

You're so far but I'll be waiting
No matter what, cause nothing changes
We'll end up right where we are meant to be
Always
We learn to love and go through phases
Run out of luck, but we'll create it
Just have to trust it's always you and me
We're in it for infinity

Don't let us break
Just be brave
I promise that it will be worth the wait
We'll find a place
Where we'll escape
Come with me I'll show you the way

Oooh
I'll never give up
No I'll never give up on you
Can we put forever on loop

You're so far but I'll be waiting
No matter what, cause nothing changes
We'll end up right where we are meant to be
Always
We learn to love and go through phases
Run out of luck, but we'll create it
Just have to trust it's always you and me
We're in it for infinity

We learn to love and go through phases
Run out of luck, but we'll create it
Just have to trust it's always you and me
We're in it for infinity
