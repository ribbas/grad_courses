Gimme gimme what I need
Cause all I need is everything
It's so it's so easy
It's so it's so easy

It's not about diamonds and gold
They come and go
I've seen it all
Stories get told
Wherever you go

Yeah you don't know
What you got
Until it's too late
But you won't know
What you got
Until you give it away
You'll never know
What you could hold
If you don't you let go

Gimme gimme what I need
Cause all I need is everything
It's so it's so easy
It's so it's so easy

No we don't need no sympathy
Cause we can touch infinity
It's so it's so easy
It's so it's so easy

Gimme gimme what I need
Cause all I need is everything
It's so it's so easy
It's so it's so easy

No we don't need no sympathy
Cause we can touch infinity
It's so it's so easy
It's so it's so easy

Hands up to sky
We stay feeling high
This ain't no goodbye, goodbye
Keep losing control
Hit bumps in the road
Who cares where we go

Yeah you don't know what you got
Until it's too late
But you won't know what you got
Until you give it away
You'll never know
What you could hold
If you don't you let go

Gimme gimme what I need
Cause all I need is everything
It's so it's so easy
It's so it's so easy

No we don't need no sympathy
Cause we can touch infinity
It's so it's so easy
It's so it's so easy

Gimme gimme what I need
Cause all I need is everything
It's so it's so easy
It's so it's so easy

No we don't need no sympathy
Cause we can touch infinity
It's so it's so easy
It's so it's so easy

Gimme gimme what I need
It's so it's so easy
It's so it's so easy

No we don't need no sympathy
Cause we can touch infinity
It's so it's so easy
It's so it's so easy
