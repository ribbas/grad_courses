When heaven takes you home
And you're at the gates alone
If the grass isn't greener
Come back and check I'm still breathing
When heaven takes you home
And you're untouchable
Tell 'em how you backflip through tragic
Show 'em how the struggle made magic
Made magic
Made magic

There's nothing wrong with you
But it has hurt, to watch you fade away
I don't want to see the end of the world without you
There's nothing wrong with you
You're perfect, you're cool
You took the best parts of you
Showed me what love can do

When heaven takes you home
And you're at the gates alone
If the grass isn't greener
Come back and check I'm still breathing
When heaven takes you home
And you're untouchable
Tell 'em how you backflip through tragic
Show 'em how the struggle made magic
Made magic
Show 'em how the struggle made magic
Made magic
Made magic
Made magic

Make me small
So I can fit in your pockets when you go
'Cause when you're gone
All of the colours turn to grey
