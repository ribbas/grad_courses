Pharaohs resting in shadows while lying under dust
Bet it, you're gonna get it if you want it enough
Tell me, do you remember how we used to be giants?
Young and you know it's coming, your blood's about to rush

All the things you said
Playing in my head
Come and see about me
You know you can find me by the pyramids

Every tear you've shed
I can take 'em back
Come and see it for yourself
You know you can find me by the pyramids

You know you can find me by the pyramids

Boredom, DNA glowing, it's right inside our veins
Blended, we are descendants of the fire and rain
Tell me, do you remember how we ran with the lions?
Dreamers, naive believers, never trying to change

All the things you said
Playing in my head
Come and see about me
You know you can find me by the pyramids

Every tear you've shed
I can take 'em back
Come and see it for yourself
You know you can find me by the pyramids

You know you can find me by the pyramids
You know I'll die for you
Already died for you
You know I'll die for you
Already died for you
