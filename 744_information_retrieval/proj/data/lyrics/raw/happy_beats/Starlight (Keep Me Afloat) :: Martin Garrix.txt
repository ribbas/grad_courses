If I have to go
Please don't tell me when
Need a little more time
I hope you understand

Like a guardian, you're watching over me
Through the depths of my own despair
I look up to the sky and I find my peace
I know you'll be there, so

Starlight, won't you lead the way down this river?
Keep me afloat, keep me afloat
If I ever drift away, would you be there?
Keep me afloat, keep me afloat

Till the end of time
Make me feel safe
Oh, I just need you next to me

Starlight, won't you lead the way down this river?
Keep me afloat, keep me afloat

Keep me afloat, keep me afloat

I see you through the clouds
I feel you when it rains
You never walk out
Even on my darkest days

Like a guardian, you're watching over me
Through the depths of my own despair
I look up to the sky and I find my peace
I know you'll be there, so

Starlight, won't you lead the way down this river?
Keep me afloat, keep me afloat
If I ever drift away, would you be there?
Keep me afloat, keep me afloat

Till the end of time
Make me feel safe
Oh, I just need you next to me

Starlight, won't you lead the way down this river?
Keep me afloat, keep me afloat

Starlight, won't you lead the way down this river?
Keep me afloat, keep me afloat

Keep me afloat, keep me afloat

Starlight, won't you lead the way down this river?
Keep me afloat, keep me afloat
