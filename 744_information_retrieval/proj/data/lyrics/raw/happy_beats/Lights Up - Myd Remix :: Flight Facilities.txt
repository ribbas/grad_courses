When the bass slide and that city lights up like, mmh-mmh
Low high and that shit lights up like "ah"

Put your hands up

I'm a MC, BYOB, bring your own bottles
VIP, MYOB, I brought my own models

Let me start, let me start, warm up
Warm up my body, warm up my soul

Let me stay, let me stay, when your lights up
Let me start, let me start, warm up
Warm up my body, warm up my soul
Let's go outside, you need to go

Let me start, let me start, warm up
Warm up my body, warm up my soul
