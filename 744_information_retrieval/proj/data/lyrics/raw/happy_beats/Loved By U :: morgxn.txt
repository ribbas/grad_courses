I wanna love like I've never been loved before
I wanna be touched like I've never been touched before
And I know it might feel bad but I know that it's worth it
'Cause I've never been loved like, like this before

And I know it might take some time but I'm willing to try
And I'm scared to death so I know that it's right

Letting someone love you is letting someone hurt you
So do what you've gotta do and I'll be standing next to you
If you gotta be loved by someone, I wanna be loved by you

(Loved, loved, loved by you, by
Loved, loved, loved by you) I wanna be loved by you
(Loved, loved, loved by you, by
Loved, loved, loved by you)

I wanna live life like nobody's ever done before
And with you by my side, I know that we can change the world
And I know that it might be hard but I know that it's worth it
'Cause I never been loved by, by you before
(Love you)

Letting someone love you is letting someone hurt you
So do what you've gotta do and I'll be standing next to you
If you gotta be loved by someone, I wanna be loved by you

(Loved, loved, loved by you, by
Loved, loved, loved by you) I wanna be loved by you
(Loved, loved, loved by you, by
Loved, loved, loved by you) I wanna be loved by you

(I wanna love, I wanna love
I wanna love, I wanna) I wanna be loved by you
(I wanna love, I wanna love
I wanna love, I wanna) I wanna be loved by you
(I wanna love, I wanna love
I wanna love, I wanna) I wanna be loved by you
