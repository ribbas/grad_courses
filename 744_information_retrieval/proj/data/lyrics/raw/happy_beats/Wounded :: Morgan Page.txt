Late nights, long drives
Down back roads
Nothing else could come close
To cheap wine, pool lights, no one home
Sneaking out to be alone

Now we both have separate lives
'Cause we move on and we get by and
Oh, oh
I met him and I thought that I'd forget the world I left behind
But no, oh

If I'm being honest
I don't know if I'll feel love
As I did when I was young
Anymore
He's all that I wanted
But you're the one I adore
There's two things I know for sure
I love him
But I'll always love you more

New state, new place
Someone new
Wish you well, I really do
And maybe our timelines just didn't align
And that's alright
Or we messed up too many times
To save us but sometimes

When he puts his hand in mine
I still feel ours intertwined and
Oh, oh

If I'm being honest
I don't know if I'll feel love
As I did when I was young
Anymore
He's all that I wanted
But you're the one that I adore
There's two things I know for sure
I love him
But I'll always love you more

I can't give him everything, not all of me
When you still have partially, some part of me
I can't give him everything, not all of me
When you still got me

If I'm being honest
I don't know if I'll feel love
As I did when I was young
Anymore
He's all that I wanted
But you're the one I adore
There's two things I know for sure
I love him
But I'll always love you more
