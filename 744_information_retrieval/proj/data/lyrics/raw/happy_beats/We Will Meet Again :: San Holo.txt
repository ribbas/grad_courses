You ever wonder where time went
Lost in the stars with all your friends
This life might be out of our hands
But I know that we will meet again
We will meet again

We will meet again
We will meet again

We will meet again
We will meet again

You ever wonder where time went
Lost in the stars with all your friends
This life might be out of our hands
But I know that we will meet again
We will meet again

We will meet again
We will meet again

We will meet again
