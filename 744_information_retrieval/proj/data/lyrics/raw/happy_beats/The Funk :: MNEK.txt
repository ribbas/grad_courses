I've tried every remedy
There ain't nothing getting me
Out of the funk I'm in
Can somebody rescue me?
'Cause I'm buried very deep
Inside the funk I'm in
I've tried every remedy
There ain't nothing getting me
Out of the funk I'm in
No I ain't getting sleep
So I made this melody
Out of the funk I'm in

'Cause when I don't feel strong enough
Baby, I let the music lift me up
Out of the funk I'm in
Out of the funk I'm in
'Cause when I don't feel strong enough
Baby, I let the music lift me up
Out of the funk I'm in
Out of the funk I'm in

I've tried every remedy
There ain't nothing getting me
Out of the funk I'm in
Can somebody rescue me?
'Cause I'm buried very deep
Inside the funk I'm in
I've tried every remedy
There ain't nothing getting me
Out of the funk I'm in
No I ain't getting sleep
So I made this melody
Out of the funk I'm in

'Cause when
'Cause when
'Cause when
'Cause when

'Cause when I don't feel strong enough
Baby, I let the music lift me up
Out of the funk I'm in
Out of the funk I'm in
'Cause when I don't feel strong enough
Baby, I let the music lift me up
Out of the funk I'm in
Out of the funk I'm in
Out of the funk I'm in
Out of the funk I'm in

'Cause when I don't feel strong enough
Baby, I let the music lift me up
Out of the funk I'm in
