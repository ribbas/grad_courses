Free yourself
Keep on moving up that mountain top
Why don't you please yourself?
If it feels so good then don't you
Baby, don't you stop
Don't stop
Don't stop
Baby, don't you

Don't stand there waiting all of your life
For the night to come and find you
The clock is ticking baby now is the time
For someone to come and hold you

You are a name not a number
Extraordinary colours
Don't you hide under cover, baby

Free yourself
Keep on moving up that mountain top
Why don't you please yourself?

Baby, don't you stop
Don't stop
Don't stop
Baby, don't you

No complications, distractions, reactions, no retractions
Only obsessions, motivations, investigation
There's new information

You are a name not a number
Extraordinary colours
Don't you hide under cover, baby

Free yourself
Keep on moving up that mountain top

Why don't you please yourself?
If it feels so good then don't you stop
