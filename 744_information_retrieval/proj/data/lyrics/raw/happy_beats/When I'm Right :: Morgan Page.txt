Woke up this morning thinking
This is gonna be one of those days
Ignored the warning feeling
Lie to myself it be okay

Till I got to work late
Boss say
You been acting differently
And I shake my head like
Ahh Nah
What can I say

I been spending my whole life
Stuck in tragic
Always hitting the red lights
Black magic

Told myself that you'd break my heart
Said you'd prove me wrong
Made me believe you
God damnit

Hate it when I'm right
Hate it when I'm right
Hate it when I'm right
Shaking my head like
God Damn, hate it when I'm right

Looking at hindsight I got
Nobody to blame but my own self
Felt that train coming
And I walked to the tracks and I sat down

And whenever we fight
Surprise
You say that you're gonna change
And I hold my head like
Ahh Nah
What can I say

Played against the odds
This won't be the last time (sure aint the first time?)
God Dammit
