(Straight up relaxing)
I made a promise to myself that I'd get away from you
(Straight up relaxing)
I'm taking the day off kicking it back and thinking us through

I like to try and make it easy
(Straight up relaxing)
Ain't nobody, no, no one's gonna stop me

Straight up relaxing in the summer
Do what I want to when I wanna
Straight up relaxing in the summer
Not even thinking about ya
Yeah, on my own time
On my own time
On my own time
On my own time
(No one's gonna stop me)

It's gonna take some time
Getting back to my peace of mind
'Cause I'm searching for a part of me
That I lost when I was with you

I like to try and make it easy
Ain't nobody, no, no one's gonna stop me

Straight up relaxing in the summer
Do what I want to when I wanna
Straight up relaxing in the summer
Not even thinking about ya
Yeah, on my own time
On my own time
On my own time
On my own time
(No one's gonna stop me, stop me)

Over and out this is goodbye
(This is goodbye)
This might just be the last time you see me
Unless you come to the beach
(To the beach)
Unless you come to the beach
(To the beach)

Straight up relaxing in the summer
Do what I want to when I wanna
Straight up relaxing in the summer
Not even thinking about ya
Yeah, on my own time
On my own time
On my own time
On my own time
(No one's gonna stop me, stop me)

I'm on my own time, feeling alright
I gotta get mine, I gotta get mine
I'm on my own time, feeling alright
I gotta get mine, I gotta get mine
