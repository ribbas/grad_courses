This could be your year
If you let go of the loneliness you fear
'Cause I know that you've been trying so hard (yeah)
Don't you know it's alright
For just a little while 'cause it made us feel alive

But at the same time
We can't belong together
Though it feels like
We were made for one another
Do you realize
We're wasted on each other
It's you
If I could love you back I would

This could be your year
'Cause your life could take you somewhere new from here
When you're on your own
You'll look back and see I'm
Just a moment in time
And we give it a try 'cause it made us feel alive

But at the same time
We can't belong together
Though it feels like
We were made for one another
Do you realize
We're wasted on each other
It's you
If I could love you back I would

If I could love
Come on now

But at the same time
We can't belong together
Though it feels like
We were made for one another
Do you realize
We're wasted on each other
It's you
If I could love you back I would

Let's belong together, what does
Let's belong together, what does
Let's belong together, what does
Let's belong together, what does...
