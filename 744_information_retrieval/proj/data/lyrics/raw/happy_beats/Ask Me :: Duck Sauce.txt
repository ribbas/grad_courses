It's up to you what you do with your life
You have just one so do what's right now
Somebody ask me

Oh Lord
Whoa, oh Lord

To every woman and every man
Save yourself and the friend who became
Somebody ask me

Oh Lord

No one knows how long it will be
Just be ready so you can live free
Somebody ask me

The biggest problem of our world today
People just don't believe that 
He's coming back one day
Somebody ask me

Somebody ask me

Whoa, oh Lord
Whoa, oh Lord
Whoa, oh Lord
Whoa, oh Lord
Whoa, oh Lord
Whoa, oh Lord

Somebody ask me

Do you
Do you
Do you
