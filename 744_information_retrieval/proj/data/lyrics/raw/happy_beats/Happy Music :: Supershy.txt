Happy music
Singin' happy music
Singin' happy music
Singin' happy music

Singin' happy music
Singin' happy music
Singin' happy music
Singin' happy music
(That's all I wanna hear)

(That's all I wanna hear, happy)
(That's all I wanna hear)

Here I am again
Deep in a love affair
Where does it begin?
It starts when you appear
And this is where I want to be
I want to sing a melody

Happy music
Singin' happy music (That's all I wanna hear)
Singin' happy music
Singin' happy music

Singin' happy music
Singin' happy music
Singin' happy music
Singin' happy music
(That's all I wanna hear)

Happy music
Singin' happy music
Singin' happy music
Singin' happy music (That's all I wanna hear)

Singin' happy music
Singin' happy music
Singin' happy music
Singin' happy music
Singin'

(That's all I wanna hear, happy)
(That's all I wanna hear, happy)
