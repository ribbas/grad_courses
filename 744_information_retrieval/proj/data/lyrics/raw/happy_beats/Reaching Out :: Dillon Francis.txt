Lay your head down on me
I'll be the one to hold you in my arms
Whenever you're scared and lonely
I'll keep you warm underneath the stars

You don't have to face it alone
Why don't you stay the night?
Hearts not meant to be on its own, yeah
It's better when two align

Yeah, I got you baby, don't give up
And I'm reaching out for ya
Reaching out for ya
My love's enough for the two of us
So I'm reaching out for ya
Reaching
Don't care what you say
I'll be there every way
To show you, babe
My love's enough for the two of us
So I'm reaching out for ya
Reaching

Don't be afraid to show me
I'll be the one who can heal your scars
And when it gets dark, just hold me
I'll be the light, I'll show you who you are

You don't have to face it alone (alone, alone)
Why don't you stay the night?
Hearts not meant to be on its own, yeah
It's better when two align

Yeah, I got you baby, don't give up
And I'm reaching out for ya
Reaching out for ya
My love's enough for the two of us
So I'm reaching out for ya
Reaching
Don't care what you say
I'll be there every way
To show you, babe
My love's enough for the two of us
So I'm reaching out for ya
Reaching

Yeah, I got you baby, don't give up
Don't give up, don't give up, don't give up
