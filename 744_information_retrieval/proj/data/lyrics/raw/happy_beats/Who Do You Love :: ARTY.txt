Should've known it, should've seen it
It was screaming all this time
I was a loner, rolling stone
I couldn't see you in that light
You were hiding
Now it's blinding like a lightning in my sky
And I have been waiting all this time
Hey, hey, hey

Who do you love?
Come on and tell me
Who do you love?
And if you're asking who am I thinking of
Who do I love?
It's you

Who do you love?
Who's got you dreaming when you wake up?
And after all is said and done
Who's the one?
Who do I love?
It's you
It's you
It's you

It's you
Who do you love?
(Who do you love?)
Said and done
Who's the one?
Who do I love?
It's you
It's you

Took a moment till I knew it
Didn't lose you just in time (Mmm)
Had some fun out on the run
But baby, you're my finish line
Hey what a feeling
What a reason to believe in being alive
And I have been waiting all this time
Hey, hey, hey

Who do you love?
Come on and tell me
Who do you love?
And if you're asking who am I thinking of
Who do I love?
It's you

Who do you love?
Who's got you dreaming when you wake up?
And after all is said and done
Who's the one?
Who do I love?
It's you
It's you
It's you

Oh, yeah, it's you
Hey, hey, hey

Who do you love?
Come on and tell me
Who do you love?
And if you're asking who am I thinking of
Who do I love?
It's you

Who do you love?
Who's got you dreaming when you wake up?
And after all is said and done
Who's the one?
Who do I love?
It's you
It's you
It's you
