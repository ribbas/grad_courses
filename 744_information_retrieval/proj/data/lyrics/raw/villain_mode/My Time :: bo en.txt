[Romanized:]

Close your eyes, you'll be here soon
Ichi ni san shi go fun
Tokidoki hontōni netai
Demo kono wādo dekinai

Oyasumi
Oyasumi
Oyasumi
Oyasu

Oyasumi, oyasumi
Close your eyes and you'll leave this dream
Oyasumi, oyasumi
I know that it's hard to do

Days go by
Shōganai
Moments pass
Shattered glass
Hands of time
Where's that chime?
In my head
I'll just
I'll just
I'll just
I'll just

Hands (hands!) Of time will wring my neck
Every little moment spells regret
But I don't have to feel this way
As a voice inside my head

Oyasumi
Oyasumi
Oyasumi
Oyasu

Oyasumi, oyasumi
Close your eyes and you'll leave this dream
Oyasumi, oyasumi
I know that it's hard to do

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

Oyasumi, oyasumi
Close your eyes and you'll leave this dream
Oyasumi, oyasumi
I know that it's hard to do
Oyasumi, oyasumi
Close your eyes and you'll leave this dream
Oyasumi, oyasumi
I know that it's hard to do

Moments pass
Shattered glass
Hands of time
Where's that chime?
In my head
I'll just

Hands (hands!) Of time will wring my neck
Every little moment spells regret
But I don't have to feel this way
As a voice inside my head
