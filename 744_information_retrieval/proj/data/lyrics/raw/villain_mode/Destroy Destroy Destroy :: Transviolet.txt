I didn't come here to beg you for what is mine
Gun to my head, we've been here a thousand times
And you're scared to death 'cause I'm seeing red with eyes known to set fires
And I didn't come here to beg you for what is mine

I came to destroy, destroy, destroy, destroy
Destroy, destroy, destroy, destroy
Destroy, destroy, destroy, destroy
Destroy, destroy, destroy, destroy

Don't need your money
Don't need to ask you where to go
I'm sugar honey
I am the one they're waiting for
Don't need your money
Don't need to ask you where to go
I'm sugar honey
I am the one they're waiting for

I'm pulling thorns while you water your poisonous vine
Standing here naked, I'm shameless, I'm something divine
Imperfect and flawless, my edges and softness, my power, my wild desire
No, I didn't come here to beg you for what is mine

I came to destroy, destroy, destroy, destroy
Destroy, destroy, destroy, destroy
Destroy, destroy, destroy, destroy
Destroy, destroy, destroy, destroy

Don't need your money
Don't need to ask you where to go
I'm sugar honey
I am the one they're waiting for
Don't need your money
Don't need to ask you where to go
I'm sugar honey
I am the one they're waiting for

Destroy, destroy, destroy, destroy
Destroy, destroy, destroy, destroy
Destroy, destroy, destroy, destroy
Destroy, destroy, destroy, destroy

Imperfect and flawless, my edges and softness, my power, my wild desire
No, I didn't come here to beg you for what is mine

I came to destroy, destroy, destroy, destroy
Destroy, destroy, destroy, destroy
Destroy, destroy, destroy, destroy
Destroy, destroy, destroy, destroy

Don't need your money
Don't need to ask you where to go
I'm sugar honey
I am the one they're waiting for
Don't need your money
Don't need to ask you where to go
I'm sugar honey
I am the one they're waiting for

Destroy, destroy, destroy, destroy
Destroy, destroy, destroy, destroy
Destroy, destroy, destroy, destroy
Destroy, destroy, destroy, destroy
