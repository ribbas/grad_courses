I want to talk to you
About the things we could do
Is it really you
Or is it déjà vu

I want to walk with you
Wherever you go to
I wanna hurt with you
Whatever you go through
I do too

That's a lot to live up to
My point of view
That's a lot to live up to
My point of view

I want to worship you
Make you feel brand new
Is that true?
You really do voodoo?
Is that true?

That's a lot to live up to
My point of view
That's a lot to live up to

I want to fuck with you
You could bring your friend too
Or is it too taboo?
Remember who you're talking to
Is it déjà vu?

That's a lot to live up to
My point of view
That's a lot to live up to
