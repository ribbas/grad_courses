A real good puss
A real good puss
A real good puss

I just wanna feel good
Gotta lay down with some good kush
Got a good girl a real good bush
Come and go get a real good puss

I just wanna feel good
Gotta lay down with some good kush
Got a good girl a real good bush
Come and go get a real good puss

Want it good wanna it all
Wanna feed waterfall
Give it good gold star
I want what I want
Feel good when I purr
Give me what I deserve
You know me like it firm
Sting let it burn

Too hard get a nurse
See God go to church
I spread get desert
Thirsty I squirt
Lipstick tight skirt
Dirty thick girl
Dive in real thirst
Eat lunch I serve

Gotta lay down with some good kush
Got a good girl a real good bush
Come and go get a real good puss

I just wanna feel good
Gotta lay down with some good kush
Got a good girl a real good bush
Come and go get a real good puss

Flow seas take a dive
Squeeze watertight
Let it soak overnight
Drip inner thigh
Sweat power play
Good juice my rain
Good puss obey
Too hot take a break

Too hard get a nurse
See God go to church
I spread get dessert
Thirsty I squirt
Lipstick tight skirt
Dirty thick girl
Dive in real thirst
Eat lunch I serve

I just wanna feel good
Gotta lay down with some good kush
Got a good girl a real good bush
Come and go get a real good puss

I just wanna feel good
Gotta lay down with some good kush
Got a good girl a real good bush
Come and go get a real good puss

A real good puss
