Sorry for acting this strange, I can't control myself
Struggling for what to say, but I could never tell

Take me closer, take my clothes off
Oh I fantasize
If I'm honest, it's more fun when you can't read my mind

Sometimes I fuck you in my head
I let you touch me when I'm lonely in my bed
I wanna scream, but hold my breath
The kinda thing that you would rather leave unsaid
I got dirty wishes on my mind
But you will never ever know that I
I like to fuck you in my head
You make me scream when there's nobody
Just the thought of your body

Sorry, I think I zoned out, can you say that again?
I, I, I am stuttering every time that I'm catching your scent

Take me closer, take my clothes off
Oh I fantasize
If I'm honest, it's more fun when you can't read my mind

Sometimes I fuck you in my head
I let you touch me when I'm lonely in my bed
I wanna scream, but hold my breath
The kinda thing that you would rather leave unsaid
I got dirty wishes on my mind
But you will never ever know that I
I like to fuck you in my head
You make me scream when there's nobody
Just the thought of your body

Do you feel it too?
Are you as obsessed?
Give me just a little sign and I'll confess
Do you feel it too?

But you will never ever know that I
I like to fuck you in my head
You make me scream when there's nobody
