I've been sleeping in a cardboard box
Spending every dollar at the liquor shop
And even though I know I haven't got a lot
I'll try to give you love until the day you drop

I've been training like a Pavlov dog
Send my independence out to take a hike
All you got to do is activate my bell
And I'll fetch you anything you like

Going once
Going twice
Every man here has a price
Over where
Over there
Sold to not a single lady in here

I've been here like a thousand times
Dated every woman in the atmosphere
I've been to every continent
Broken all the hearts in every hemisphere
And if I'm not the type of guy you like to circumvent
Just remember not to love me when I disappear

I graduated at the top
I like to take advantage of the bourgeoisie
So if you have a fantasy of being a queen
Maybe you should blow a couple bucks on me

Going once
Going twice
Won't these gentlemen suffice?
Any here
Any there
Any motions anywhere

Going twice
Going thrice
Guess this means we'll go four times a lady

I promise I'll be all you'll need
Ever need
You'll never have to shop around
(Don't shop around)
And I'll give you all you'll ever need
Ever need
Don't worry; I will never let you down
Let you down
Don't worry; I will never let you down

So many ladies
Are wanting for mates
And the prospects are good
But the date's never great
Over here
Over there
Over where
Anywhere
They're too busy
With winning
The bidding
To care
And he's sold
