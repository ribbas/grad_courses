Do you wanna meet all my monsters?
Think you're tough? I know they'll drive you bonkers
Meet 'em once and they'll forever haunt ya, yeah
There's no heroes or villains in this place
Just shadows that dance in my headspace
Leavin' nothin' but phantoms in their wake (Their wake)

There's parts of me I cannot hide
I've tried and tried a million times
La-da-da-de-da, la-da-da-de-da, la-da-da-de-da-da
Cross my heart and hope to die
Welcome to my dark side
Ooh, to my dark, dark, dark side
Ooh, to my dark, dark, dark side
Ooh, to my dark, dark, dark side
Ooh, to my dark, dark, dark side

Take a step into the havoc
Look around, this ain't even the half of it
I'm walking the line between panic and losing my mind
Embracing the madness
My devils, they whisper in my ear
Deafenin' me with all my fears
I'm livin' in a nightmare

There's parts of me I cannot hide
I've tried and tried a million times (Million times)
La-da-da-de-da, la-da-da-de-da, la-da-da-de-da-da
Cross my heart and hope to die
Welcome to my dark side
Ooh, to my dark, dark, dark side
Ooh, to my dark, dark, dark side
Ooh, to my dark, dark, dark side
Ooh, to my dark, dark, dark side

(Ah)
Dark side (Ah)
Cross my heart and hope to die
Welcome to my dark side

Ooh, to my dark, dark, dark side
Ooh, to my dark, dark, dark side
Ooh, to my dark, dark, dark side
Ooh, to my dark, dark, dark side
