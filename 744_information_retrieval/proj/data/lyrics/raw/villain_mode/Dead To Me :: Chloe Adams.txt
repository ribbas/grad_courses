I've been hanging pictures of you on my wall
Drawing crosses on your eyes like a sinner, oh
I was young, and you'd spit venom in my face
You should've known that that would leave a bitter taste

Ooh, you always see the worst
Ooh, won't let you kill me first

You are dead to me
'Cause what you said to me
Cut so deep
And now you're dead to me
Dead to me
You were a friend to me
But I put you to sleep
And now you're dead to me

It's a shame
You're to blame
You made the rules but still fucked up your own damn game

(Dead to me)
(Dead to me)

When did we decide to skip the niceties?
Or were there even times when you were nice to me? (No)
So go be shady
And I'll be the monster that you made me

Ooh, you always see the worst
Ooh, I'll make your bubble burst

You are dead to me
'Cause what you said to me
Cut so deep
And now you're dead to me
Dead to me
You were a friend to me
But I put you to sleep
And now you're dead to me

It's a shame
You're to blame
You made the rules but still fucked up your own damn game

(Dead to me)
(Dead to me)
(Dead to me)

Dead to me
Said to me
Cut so deep
Dead to me
Dead to me
Friend to me
You to sleep
Dead to me
