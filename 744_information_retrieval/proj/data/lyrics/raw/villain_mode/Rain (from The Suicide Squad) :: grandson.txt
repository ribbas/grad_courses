I do not mind the rain sometimes
'Cause that's the only way the roses bloom
In my mind, when I cry, when I cry
That's the only way the roses bloom

It's okay, I'm not okay, I
Feel the disarray of yesterday, oh my
I need to feel the raindrops
On my head, on my head
I know I know nothing so, I
Embrace what I cannot control, oh my
Trouble walks beside me
Till my end, till my end

I do not mind the rain sometimes
'Cause that's the only way the roses bloom
In my mind, when I cry, when I cry
'Cause that's the only way that the roses bloom (yuh, yuh)

It's better to have loved and lost, but
The feeling, it comes at a cost, oh my
My poor heart is
My only friend, only friend
And I've come to love a heavy sky (heavy sky)
The lightning couldn't beat my shine, oh my
Trouble walks beside me
Till my end, till my end

I do not mind the rain sometimes
'Cause that's the only way the roses bloom
In my mind, when I cry, when I cry
'Cause that's the only way that the roses bloom

Hand on my heart, I said I made
Peace with the rain (peace with the rain)
Peace with the rain (peace with the rain)
Now I dance with the pain (yeah, come closer) yeah (dance with me)
Hand on my heart, I said I made
Peace with the rain (peace with the rain)
Peace with the rain (peace with the rain)
Now I slow dance with the pain ('cause that's when) yeah (roses bloom)

(Roses, roses
That's the only way the roses bloom, yeah) yeah

I do not mind the rain sometimes
'Cause that's the only way the roses bloom
In my mind, when I cry, when I cry
'Cause that's the only way (that the roses bloom)
That's the only way the roses bloom
