Hey, baby, why don't you smile?
You got such a pretty face
(I know, I know, I know oh)
I'm only here for a while
I want more than a taste
(I know, I know, I know oh)

I'm about to set my world on fire
(Oh, oh, oh well)
I smashed my glass on the bar
Guess I got carried away
(Oh well)

You told me
Nobody likes an angry woman
I always say the things I shouldn't
Oh what a shame my tongue's not tied
You can do whatever you want
I'll do whatever I like

You think you're so mature
You want the party to stop
(I know, I know, I know oh)
Lately you're eating your words
You said my sound wasn't pop
(Enough, enough, for you)

Well, I'm about to set your world on fire
This song's not even about you
Bet you'll think that it was
(But it's not)

OoooAAAHHH...

You told me
Nobody likes an angry woman
I always say the things I shouldn't
Oh what a shame my tongue's not tied
You can do whatever you want
I'll do whatever I like

Thank you very much for the let-down
Used to want your love but it ran out
Used to give a fuck but I don't now
But I don't now
But I don't now

You can do whatever you want
I'll do whatever I like
