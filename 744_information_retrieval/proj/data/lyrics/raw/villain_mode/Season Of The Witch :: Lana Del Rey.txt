When I look out my window
Many sights to see
And when I look in my window
So many different people to be

They're strange, so strange
It's very strange to me

You've got to pick up every stitch (Gonna be)
You've got to pick up every stitch (Gonna be, gonna be)
You've got to pick up every stitch
Oh no, must be the season of the witch
Must be the season of the witch
Must be the season of the witch

(Gonna be)

When I look over my shoulder (What happens then?)
What do you think I see? (Mm)
Some other cat looking over (Shadoop, shadoop)
Over the shoulder at me (Ah, at me)

And he's strange, so strange (So strange)
He's very strange to me

You've got to pick up every stitch (Gonna be)
You've got to pick up every stitch (Gonna be, gonna be)
Beatniks are out to make it rich
Oh no, must be the season of the witch
Must be the season of the witch
Must be the season of the witch

Witch, witch
Said it must be the season, must be the season, must be the season (Witch)
Said it must be the season, must be the season, must be the season (Of the witch)
Said it must be the season, must be the season, must be the season (Witch) (You've got to pick up every stitch)
Said it must be the season, must be the season, must be the season (Witch) (You've got to pick up every stitch)
Said it must be the season, must be the season, must be the season (Witch)
(Must be the season of the witch)
Witch (Must be the season of the witch)

Witch, witch
Witch, witch
Witch, witch
Witch, witch
