I might be the villain
In somebody else's story
But that's fine

My methods are controversial
But at least it keeps them all in line
In line

I don't need your roses
I like men on their knees
Praying up to their god
Seeing visions of me

I'm a cult leader
Mind reader
Heart eater
Fear feeder
Say I'm your
Favorite preacher
If I wasn't a narcissist
I wouldn't like me either

I'm a cult leader
Best believe that she's a keeper
Grim reaper
Looking for my
Cheerleaders
If it's between love and money
I'd rather have neither

So charming
Its alarming
I'm hurting everybody that I know

Lead the masses
From the ashes
I want power and I think it shows

I don't need your roses
I like men on their knees
Praying up to their god
Seeing visions of me

I'm a cult leader
Mind reader
Heart eater
Fear feeder
Say I'm your
Favorite preacher
If I wasn't a narcissist
I wouldn't like me either

I'm a cult leader
Best believe that she's a keeper
Grim reaper
Looking for my
Cheerleaders
If it's between love and money
I'd rather have neither

I wanna be a leader, leader, leader, no
Leader..., leader, leader, no
Leader, leader, leader, no
Leader, leader, leader, no
Leader, keeper, best

Leader
Keeper
Best believe her
You ain't ever seen them
Do it quite like me
