[Night Lovell:]
No chance you catch me down bad (No chance)
P90, aim straight for your head (No way)
Callin' up my bitch, yeah, she know she at the top of the list
Said she pulled up with her friends, so I (Uh, ayy)

[CORPSE:]
Tell her throw it back, then I blow a bag
Drop it down low, let 'em know it's like that
Feel like I'm hexed, yeah, that bitch bad
Collar on her neck and her ass real fat
Tell her throw it back, then I blow a bag
Drop it down low, let 'em know it's like that
Feel like I'm hexed, yeah, that bitch bad
Collar on her neck and her ass real fat, yeah

[Night Lovell:]
She keep on sayin' that she never had a nigga like this (Nigga like this)
Let's shake it up, still the realest nigga in the mix (On God)
Why they always actin' like a nigga ain't shit? (I don't know)
Told 'em "Sleep," then we empty out the clip (Okay, uh)
Six figures for the whip, bitch, you ain't gon' tell me shit
Stuck to my body, I'm the dog, she the tick
I'm the god, pussy, this ain't no motherfuckin' fa√ßade
My niggas comfy at the top, we ain't never took a loss (Brr)

[CORPSE:]
Demon girl Slan, chain, fangs, got an OnlyFans
Fuckin' on a succubus, I feel like I'm Devilman
Bloody when I'm up in it, harness with a pentagram
How you get a plaque while independent? It was in the plan
She's fucked, yeah, same as my bitch (Uwu)
I'm CORPSE, got it tatted in my skin (CORPSE)
Autopilot whip, black matted with the tint
Got her suckin' on my dick while we bump Trip 6

Tell her throw it back, then I blow a bag
Drop it down low, let 'em know it's like that
Feel like I'm hexed, yeah, that bitch bad
Collar on her neck and her ass real fat
Tell her throw it back, then I blow a bag
Drop it down low, let 'em know it's like that
Feel like I'm hexed, yeah, that bitch bad
Collar on her neck and her ass real fat, yeah
