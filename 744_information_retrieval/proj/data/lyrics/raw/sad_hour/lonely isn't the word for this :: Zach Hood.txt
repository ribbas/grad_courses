Lonely isn't the word for this
Didn't know I could hurt like this
Wouldn't wish it on anyone
Not even you

She was the first girl I kissed out in California
We had the windows down, we're flyin' on the 405
It gave me butterflies, the taste of some paranoia
She didn't know it then but I never felt so alive

You planned it out
Yeah you said it in a voice note
I called you up but you sent me straight to voicemail
Oh well I guess that it's set in stone

Lonely isn't the word for this
Didn't know I could hurt like this
Wouldn't wish it on anyone
Not even you
Lonely isn't the word for this
Didn't know I could hurt like this
Wouldn't wish it on anyone
Not even you

She was the first thing I wanted since Alabama (Alabama)
Yeah but I couldn't hold her close even if I tried (If I tried)

You planned it out
Yeah you said it in a voice note
I called you up but you sent me straight to voicemail (Voicemail)
Oh well I guess that it's set in stone (Set in stone)
(It's set in stone)

Lonely isn't the word for this
Didn't know I could hurt like this
Wouldn't wish it on anyone
Not even you
Lonely isn't the word for this
Didn't know I could hurt like this
Wouldn't wish it on anyone
Not even you

'Cause I get, didn't get you
I don't get why I miss you
'Cause it's a waste of time
You're always on my mind
It doesn't matter what I did
It wasn't worth a dime

Lonely isn't the word for this
Didn't know I could hurt like this
Wouldn't wish it on anyone
Not even you
