He'd take the world off my shoulders
If it was ever hard to move
He'd turn the rain to a rainbow
When I was living in the blue
Why then, if he's so perfect
Do I still wish that it was you?
Perfect don't mean that it's working
So what can I do?

When you're out of sight
In my mind

'Cause sometimes I look in his eyes
And that's where I find a glimpse of us
And I try not fall for his touch
But I'm thinking of the way it was
Said I'm fine, said I moved on
I'm only here passing time in his arms
Hoping I'll find a glimpse of us

Tell me she savors your glory
Does she laugh the way I did?
Is this a part of your story
One that I had never lived?
Maybe one day, you'll feel lonely
And in her eyes, you'll get a glimpse
Maybe you'll start slipping slowly
And find me again

When you're out of sight
In my mind

'Cause sometimes I look in his eyes
And that's where I find a glimpse of us
And I try not fall for his touch
But I'm thinking of the way it was
Said I'm fine, said I moved on
I'm only here passing time in his arms
Hoping I'll find a glimpse of us

'Cause sometimes I look in his eyes
And that's where I find a glimpse of us
And I try not fall for his touch
But I'm thinking of the way it was
Said I'm fine, said I moved on
I'm only here passing time in his arms
Hoping I'll find a glimpse of us
