Roses red and
Violets lookin' blue like me
So poetic

So pathetic
To think I ever thought you'd be
Sympathetic

I know you don't care at all
Please don't ask how I been
I ain't heard from you in months
So don't call me a friend when you're not

So I'm just gon put on a sad song
And sit in my room with the lights off
And put on a face that I won't show anyone

Yeah I'm just gon' put on a sad song
And cry out my eyes til the nights gone
And put on a face that I don't show anyone

So don't call me a friend when you're not
So don't call me a friend when you're not

Feeling depressed
Yeah I been dealing with stress
These demons they fight me

Cut out the fakes
Yeah I been dealing with snakes
And They try to bite me

I been down so bad, with nobody near me
I been down so sad, can anyone hear me?
I turned my back, I got stabbed
I'm so sad, sad

Feeling depressed
Yeah I been dealing with stress
These demons they fight me

Cut out the fakes
Yeah I been dealing with snakes
And They try to bite me

I been down so bad, with nobody near me
I been down so sad, can anyone hear me?

I been down so sad
