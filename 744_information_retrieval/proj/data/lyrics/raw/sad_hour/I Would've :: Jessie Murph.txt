I would've loved you
Would've stayed up all night
I could've loved you
For the rest of your life
Would've taken the cocaine off your lips
Ripped out the bottle from your fist
I would've loved you
I, I

Woke up at the bottom of my bed, the bottom, baby
Went through hell and back for you and this how you repay me
Put two and two together, you sound motherfuckin' crazy
Switched that back to back and now you wish you pushin' daisies
So you fuckin' hate it

And when you walk this road alone, 'lone, 'lone
Feeling sorry, feelin' low, low, low
There's no one far beside you, oh, oh, oh

I would've loved you
Would've stayed up all night
I could've loved you
For the rest of your life
Would've taken the cocaine off your lips
Ripped out the bottle from your fist
I would've loved you
I, I would've loved you

Who knew? That bitch has a screw loose
Could've had honest, woo-hoo
Now you're gon' fuck with this voodoo, yeah
Sideways, now just look at you sideways
Bro' get the fuck out my driveway
You broke the window with no pain
Yeah

So when you walk this road alone, 'lone, 'lone
Feeling sorry, feelin' low, low, low
There's no one far beside you, oh, oh, oh

I would've loved you
Would've stayed up all night
I could've loved you
For the rest of your life
Would've taken the cocaine off your lips
Ripped out the bottle from your fist
I would've loved you
I, I

I would've loved you
I, I would've loved you

I, I
