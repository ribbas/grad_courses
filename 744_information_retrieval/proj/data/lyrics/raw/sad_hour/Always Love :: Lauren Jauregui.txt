It's kinda hard waking up in the morning without you
When I reach over and realize it's over, I just
Let the memories wash over me
Through me, and out of me
But they're still on the sheets
And they stay there
So I'll lay there with you

And even though it didn't work
It's always love, always love
And even though we hurt each other
More than once it's was love, always love
For all those times we locked eyes
When I was yours and you were mine
It's always love, always love

Nobody talks about walking away
When there's still love
Feeling so far after being so close is a mindfuck
You helped me grow into me
So I couldn't help but change
But changing is messy some days
And I just couldn't change

And even though it didn't work
It's always love, always love
And even though we hurt each other
More than once it's was love, always love
For all those times we locked eyes
When I was yours and you were mine
It's always love, always love...

And even though it didn't work
It's always love, always love
And even though we hurt each other
More than once it's was love, always love
For all those times we locked eyes
When I was yours and you were mine
It's always love
Oh, it's always love
It's always love, always love
