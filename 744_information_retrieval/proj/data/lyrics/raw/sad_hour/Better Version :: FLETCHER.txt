I was kind, I was warm, I was patient
All the nights that you cried when you're wasted
Hold your hand, rub your chest when you're anxious
Helped you with the career you were making
Look at you, you're a star, I'm the reason
That you're more confident, motivated

And honestly, your new girlfriend should thank me
For how it all worked out
I guess you're all grown up now

Do you think of me when you fuck her?
Do you use the moves, the ones we learned?
It's always the next person
That gets the better version
'Cause baby, I loved you at your worst
And I fixed your heart but mine still hurts
And now some other person
Is gonna get the better version of you
Of you

We were young, we were dumb, we had issues
But I thought I could work on 'em with you
God knows that we tried, yeah, we tried so hard (So hard)
And I did the heavy lifting
But she'll get a happy ending
Now the credits are rolling, I played my part

Do you think of me when you fuck her?
Do you use the moves, the ones we learned?
It's always the next person
That gets the better version
'Cause baby, I loved you at you worst
And I fixed your heart but mine still hurts
And now some other person
Is gonna get the better version of you
Of you, of you, of you

You were kind, you were warm, you were patient
Helped me with the career I was making
Look at me, I'm a star, you're the reason

And I think of you when I fuck her
I use the moves, the ones we learned
It's always the next person
That gets the better version
'Cause baby, you loved me at my worst
And you fixed my heart but the thing that hurts
Is now some other person
Is gonna get the better version
And now some other person
Is gonna get the better version of me
