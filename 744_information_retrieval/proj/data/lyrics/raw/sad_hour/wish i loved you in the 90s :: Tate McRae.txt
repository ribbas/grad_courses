You said you'd never lie, but you did it anyway
So how am I supposed to feel when you said it so real to my face?
And you said you'd make a promise, but a promise never stays
So how am I supposed to act when it's just how it is nowadays?

And I swear we've kinda fell in love with the pain
And I'm scared we don't even know the right way

Wish I loved you in the 90's
'Cause I know that we would work
Say wrong place, wrong time, should've been alive
I bet it wouldn't hurt
If I had loved you in the 90's
Back when life wasn't a blur
Say right guy, right vibe, wouldn't have to try
I bet it wouldn't hurt
If I had loved you in the 90's
If I had loved you in the 90's

What happened to the guy, picking up the girl?
And now you speed down the highway and don't care to say a word
In my head it's kinda dreamy, I imagine it with you
On the lawn, record on, looking at the sky like '92

Oh and I swear we've kinda fell in love with the pain
And I'm scared we don't even know the right way

Wish I loved you in the 90's
'Cause I know that we would work
Say wrong place, wrong time, should've been alive
I bet it wouldn't hurt
If I had loved you in the 90's
Back when life wasn't a blur
Say right guy, right vibe, wouldn't have to try
I bet it wouldn't hurt
If I had loved you in the 90's
If I had loved you in the 90's

Wish I loved you in the 90's
'Cause I know that we would work
Say wrong place, wrong time
Bet it wouldn't hurt
