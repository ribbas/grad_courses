Smoke detector on the ceiling
I already know the feeling
Devil on my shoulder's real
We've been here before
Constellations in the carpet
And it's not even getting dark yet
There's always thunder in August
Before the storm

Now my friends don't call me anymore cuz they know that
I won't make it out the door to come over
Used to the weight of the world on my shoulders
Ah

Help me
I'm still waiting for someone to tell me
This won't last forever but it's hell for me
Just to remind myself I'm supposed to breathe
And there ain't nobody else that can
Help me
Screaming in the shower isn't healthy
Holding it together but it's hell for me
I'm not the person that I'm supposed to be

I don't think I'm making progress
Talk about a fucking process
I don't wanna have to
Work for it anymore
No wonder I wake up exhausted
When I'm every night I'm turn and tossing
Cuz all I do is think about
What I don't wanna think about
Ah

Help me
I'm still waiting for someone to tell me
This won't last forever but it's hell for me
Just to remind myself I'm supposed to breathe
And there ain't nobody else that can
Help me
Screaming in the shower isn't healthy
Holding it together but it's hell for me
I'm not the person that I'm supposed to be
Now my friends don't call me anymore cuz they know that
I won't make it out the door to come over
Used to the weight of the world on my shoulders
Ah
