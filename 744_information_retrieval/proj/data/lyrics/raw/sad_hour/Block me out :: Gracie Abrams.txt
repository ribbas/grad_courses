I'll say whatever you want, but I've become such a liar
I used to follow my gut, but now I'm just getting higher
It's been a couple of months since I turned to something violent
I should be happier now, so why do I feel this quiet?

Now I only let me down
When there's no one else around
I've been thinking way too loud
I wish that I could block me out

I wish that I could block me out
Out

I think I'm burning alive, but nobody sees the fire
'Cause when I open my mouth, I seem to be stuck in silence
I thought of leaving tonight, but I couldn't drive this tired
Plus after all of this time, I should be a pretty crier

And now I only let me down
When there's no one else around
I've been thinking way too loud
I wish that I could block me out
Don't know how they see me now
Feeling lost in every crowd
I feel ten feet off the ground
I wish that I could block me out

And in my head, I make a mess of it
I'm getting tired of feeling delicate
I look around, to find it desolate
I used to try, but nothing's helping it
And in my head, I make a mess of it
I'm getting tired of feeling delicate
I look around, to find it desolate
I used to try, but nothing's helping it

Wish I were heavier now I'm floating outside my body
It's not their fault, but I've found that none of my friends will call me
Until I'm left to myself, it's honestly kind of funny
How every voice in my head is trying its best to haunt me

'Cause now I only let me down
When there's no one else around
I've been thinking way too loud
I wish that I could block me out
Don't know how they see me now
Feeling lost in every crowd
I feel ten feet off the ground
I wish that I could block me out
Out

I wish that I could block me out
I wish that I could block me out
