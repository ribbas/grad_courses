I never wrote the letter that I swore I'd send
I never got to tell you what I really meant
I'm passing Pasadena, do you still live in LA?
'Cause I can't help but think of all the things that I would say

If I showed up at your doorstep
Would you turn me away?
Or would you care to see a stranger whose eyes are still the same?
Take me or leave me I'm going home
But I'd rather be going your way so
Would you love me now?
Take me back to when we were young again darling
Would you love me now?
After everything would you let me in and love me now?

We made ourselves a promise we would stay in touch
So if we're being honest that's on both of us
And I've still got the Converse that I wore the day we met
I'm running out of reasons not to do it all again so

If I showed up at your doorstep
Would you turn me away?
Or would you care to see a stranger
Whose eyes are still the same?
Take me or leave me I'm going home
But I'd rather be going your way so
Would you love me now?
Take me back to when we were young again darling
Would you love me now?
After everything would you let me in and love me now?

You know I'd fly away with you if you asked me to
So what do you say, for one more day?

If I showed up at your doorstep
Would you turn me away? Oh
Or would you care to see a stranger
Whose eyes are still the same?
Take me or leave me I'm going home
But I'd rather be going your way so
Would you love me now?
Take me back to when we were young again darling
Would you love me now?
After everything would you let me in and love me now?

Would you love me
Would you love me
Would you love me now?
Would you love me
Would you love me
Would you love me now?
