And now life is back to normal
I don't feel like crying when I drive
Even on the streets we used to ride down in July
And I guess I sound so healthy
Dealing with the blinding heartbreak shit
Even though I'm finally done with it, I kinda wish
That I still had one piece of sadness
Like seeing you and her laughing
Guess you're really over it when
You'd go through it all again

'Cause now I realize missing you, missing you
Was me calling up my mom
Bonding over all your wrongs
Now I realize missing you, missing you
Was staying at Ryan's way too long
Writing albums worth of songs
Now I realize missing you
Gave me something to do

And I moved back to the valley
I'm not getting triggered anymore
So I'm not getting ice cream from the store like before
I don't say much when someone calls
They ask, "What's up?" Nothing at all
When I was broken I was living, now I'm boring just like golf

And now I realize missing you, missing you
Was me calling up my mom
Bonding over all your wrongs
Now I realize missing you, missing you
Was staying at Ryan's way too long
Writing albums worth of songs
Now I realize missing you
Gave me something to...

Do with myself
When I was going through hell
You gave me stories to tell
You'd say that I told them well
In all those songs that I made
To all my friends when we'd hang
Oh, but I still wouldn't change
Anything

'Cause now I realize missing you, missing you
Was me calling up my mom
Bonding over all your wrongs
Now I realize missing you, missing you
Was staying at Ryan's way too long
Writing albums worth of songs
Now I realize missing you
Gave me something to do
