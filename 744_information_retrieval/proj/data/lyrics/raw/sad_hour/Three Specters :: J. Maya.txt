Grey hairs form a ring around my head
Don't know how they got there
Maybe I should dye 'em red

I wonder how people can talk about the past and go to bed
The space around me fills with specters of what I should've said

The past is a presence
The future is pretend
And the present is a pastor
Trying to make it all make sense

Will I ever leave this place
This world that I am trying to break?
The mind is such a funny space
With all these specters centerstage

I wander through these cities trying to see myself
In reflections, my infection, I find you once again
In the bed that we made, the things that we craved that always had to end

The past is unfinished
The future is a friend
'Cause the present is diminished
By the demons I defend

Will I ever leave this place
This world that I am trying to break?
The mind is such a funny space
With all these specters centerstage

These ghosts of seasons past
All these fears that everlast
Oh, they haunt me
Oh, they haunt me

But all they've ever known
Is to live and find a home
All they wanted
All they wanted
