You left a hole in my chest
When you left
And my heart followed you out the door

And I stood and bled in the hall
Watched it all
And the mess that it left on the floor

If I gave you less would you want me more?
And you could've said anything at all

Ooh, embers in the dark
Can look just like shooting stars
To a bitter broken heart
Oh, I wish I hadn't burned this city down
'Cause you didn't care, no you didn't care
Yeah, I burned LA down and you left me there
Oh, you left me there

I waste my breath on a prayer
You don't care
I was never a part of your plan

You can't make a god
Of somebody who's not
Even half of a half decent man

Ooh, embers in the dark
Can look just like shooting stars
To a bitter broken heart
Oh, I wish I hadn't burned this city down
'Cause you didn't care, no you didn't care
Yeah, I burned LA down and you left me there
Oh, you left me there

I burned this city down
'Cause you didn't care, no you didn't care
Yeah, I burned LA down and you left me there
Oh, you left me there

You left a hole in my chest
When you left
And my heart followed you out the door
