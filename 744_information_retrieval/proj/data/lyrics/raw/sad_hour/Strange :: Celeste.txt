I tried for you
Tried to see through all the smoke and
It wouldn't move
What could I do?

I touch your hand
To pull your thoughts
Into my hand
But now I can't say

Isn't it strange?
Isn't it strange
I am still me
You are still you
In the same place?

Isn't it strange
How people can change
From strangers to friends
Friends into lovers
And strangers again?

Back to this room
Back to our roots
What did we lose?
What did we lose?

If I could
I'd pull your strings
For one more dance
But I can't say

Isn't it strange?
Isn't it strange
You look at me
I look at you
With nothing to say?

Isn't it strange
How people can change
From strangers to friends
Friends into lovers
And strangers again?

Then the silence steals over to my bedside
And it whispers who I am
That violent disclosure turns my insides
Stops me when I try to stand

Isn't it strange
How people can change
From strangers to friends
Friends into lovers
And strangers again?
