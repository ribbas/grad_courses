We put men on the moon
But I still don't know how to get to you
And now all I can do
Is wait for you to come down
We built weapons of war
But I'm out of bullets to fire
My temper is short
But I'm here giving up my ground

Ooh, it's only war if there's a winner
Ooh, it's only hell if there's a sinner
Ooh, and I'd do all the things we didn't
Ooh, 'cause I choose you
Yeah, I choose you

We put men on the moon
But I can't figure out what is missin'
And in every room
You're right in front of me
We find pictures in stars
But they're thousands of miles away
And I'll give you my all
But you take and you take and you take

Ooh, it's only war if there's a winner
Ooh, it's only hell if there's a sinner
Ooh, and I'd do all the things we didn't
Ooh, 'cause I choose you
Yeah, I choose you
I do

I'm not the same as I was before
I'll go through the walls and kick down doors
No, I'm not the same as I was before
And I wouldn't hurt you anymore

(I'm not the same as I was before)
It's only war if there's a winner
(I'll go through the walls and kick down doors)
It's only hell if there's a sinner
(No, I'm not the same as I was before)
And I'd do all the things we didn't
(And I wouldn't hurt you anymore)
'Cause I choose you
Yeah, I choose you
I do
