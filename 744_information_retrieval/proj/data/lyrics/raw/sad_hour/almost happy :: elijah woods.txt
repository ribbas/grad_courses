Dark rum in a Kool-Aid
Little bit fucked up on a Tuesday
Spend the night just tryna forget you
Did you leave or did I let you? Oh
No call, no warning
If I didn't wake up in the morning
Would your world just keep on spinning?
Would it hurt that I'm not in it?

Oh, I'm almost happy tonight
God I wish that I could have the time of my life like
Oh, I say I'm doing alright
Don't tell me how to figure it out
I'm almost happy tonight
I'm almost happy tonight
I'm almost happy

Not much but I'm something
Broke my heart and I said it meant nothing
Playing cold I thought I could fix you
Overlooking all of my issues
When all that I've got left of you is pain
I think it's time that I should call it by its name

Oh, I'm almost happy tonight
God I wish that I could have the time of my life like
Oh, I say I'm doing alright
Don't tell me how to figure it out
I'm almost happy tonight
I'm almost happy tonight
I'm almost happy tonight
I'm almost happy tonight

Oh, I'm almost happy tonight
God I wish that I could have the time of my life like
Oh, I say I'm doing alright
Don't tell me how to figure it out
I'm almost happy tonight
