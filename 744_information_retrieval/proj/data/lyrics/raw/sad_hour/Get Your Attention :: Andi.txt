I love to think I'm overthinking it all
That you're just busy and that's why
You haven't called me tonight
I'd hate for you to know that I'm waiting here
I'm wrapped around your finger tips
Boy, you don't know what I would give to

Not ruin the night when your name is said
Sneak off to cry when I'm out with my friends
So much to say but until then

I'm gonna kiss someone else
Say "it's not about you"
Pretend I don't care, my arms aren't around you
It hurts just a little, that I won't mention
The things I would do just to get your attention
I'd blow up your phone hoping that you might answer
I'd lay it all out then say "I don't remember"
I feel like we need a damn intervention
The things I would do just to get your attention

I wish you knew about the effect that you have
On my decisions and my life
That's why I'm anxious all the time

You ruin my night when your name is said
Sneak off to cry when I'm out with my friends
There's so much to say but until then

I'm gonna kiss someone else
Say "it's not about you"
Pretend I don't care, my arms aren't around you
It hurts just a little, that I won't mention
The things I would do just to get your attention
I'd blow up your phone hoping that you might answer
I'd lay it all out then say "I don't remember"
I feel like we need a damn intervention
The things I would do just to get your attention

There's a whole lot that I never did
I could've told you how much this meant
Even if I had the chance

Don't wanna kiss someone else it'd be about you
We both know I care, my arms aren't around you
Hurts more than a little
But that I won't mention
The things I'd do just to get your attention
I'd blow up your phone hoping that you might answer
I'd lay it all out then say "I don't remember"
I feel like we need a damn intervention
The things I'd do just to get your attention

The things I'd do just to get your attention
