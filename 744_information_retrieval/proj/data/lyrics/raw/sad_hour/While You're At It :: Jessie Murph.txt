Baby, while you're at it
Why don't you rip this damn heart out my chest?
And baby, while you're at it
Why don't you take back every word you said?

It's two weeks over
Feel ten years older
I was stayin' sober
'Til you walked in
That party up in Dixon
Emotion I was riskin'
That shit that I was mixin'
Made me fall back in

Seein' you with her I'm thinkin' 'bout how you'd hold me
With this shit in my cup I'm feelin' just like the old me
Point that gun and pull the trigger
Pretend I was never with ya (Oh-oh)

And baby, while you're at it
Why don't you rip this damn heart out my chest?
And baby, while you're at it
Why don't you take back every word you said?
If you wanna tell me that I ain't the one
If you wanna tell me that it wasn't love
Then, baby, while you're at it
Why don't you rip this damn heart out my chest?

You got it bad
Shit, I got it worse
Had all the perks
And you got the Henny, I got the hurt (Yeah-yeah)
Still got that smile
Man, you got some nerve
If you're here to watch me burn then

Baby, while you're at it
Why don't you rip this damn heart out my chest?
And baby, while you're at it
Why don't you take back every word you said?
If you wanna tell me that I ain't the one
Might as well take all the air out my lungs
Rip this damn heart out my chest

Baby, while you're at it
Hmm-mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm
Baby, while you're at it
Hmm-mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm
