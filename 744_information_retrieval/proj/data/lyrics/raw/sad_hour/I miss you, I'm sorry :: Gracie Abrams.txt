Do you remember
Happy together?
I do
Don't you?

Then all of a sudden
You're sick to your stomach
Is that
Still true?

Said forever, in the end, I fought it
Please be honest, are we better for it?
Thought you'd hate me but instead you called and
Said, "I miss you," I caught it

Good to each other
Give it the summer
I knew
You too

But I only saw you
Once in December
I'm still
Confused

You said forever and I almost bought it
I miss fighting in your old apartment
Breaking dishes when you're disappointed
I still love you, I promise

Nothing happened in the way I wanted
Every corner of this house is haunted
And I know you said that we're not talking
But I miss you, I'm sorry

I don't wanna go
Think I'll make it worse
Everything I know brings me back to us

I don't wanna go
We been here before
Everywhere I go leads me back to you

I don't wanna go
Think I'll make it worse
Everything I know brings me back to us

I don't wanna go
We been here before
Everywhere I go leads me back to you

I don't wanna go
Think I'll make it worse
Everything I know brings me back to us

I don't wanna go
We been here before
Everywhere I go leads me back to you

I don't wanna go
Think I'll make it worse
Everything I know brings me back to us

I don't wanna go
We been here before
Everywhere I go leads me back to you
