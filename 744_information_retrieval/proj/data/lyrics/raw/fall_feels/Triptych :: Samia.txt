Keeping you awake, keeping you awake on purpose
Hey, did I make a mistake and do my mistakes worsen?
I would give it up to every man I love
I take what I can get
And every woman too, I would too
That's my only secret left

I will entertain your feet or your hands for a triptych
Sell me at the Strand on the stands for a fat brick
I get what I want, and your girlfriend too
Make a predator of me

I'll be good to you
(I'm worth it)
(I'm worth it)

So before I turn it off, little light at my bedstand
Ask me what I thought of the life that I led and
I'll take off your pants, say goodnight to the ears there
Put you where I sing in the light in the damp air

And I'll be good to you
I'll be good to you

I'm the moving mouth, moving mouth with my eyes closed
Breathing an excuse, breathing loose through my new nose
I will buy a round on your dime like I used to
Feeding you my cake, you my cake, eating it too

I'll be good to you
I'll be good to you
