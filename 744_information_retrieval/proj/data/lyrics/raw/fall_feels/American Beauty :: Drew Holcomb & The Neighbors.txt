She was a good companion, eyes like the Grand Canyon
She was an American beauty
She was a long goodbye, she was the best alibi
She was an American beauty

With her Wayfarers on in the summer sun
Her touch felt like a loaded gun
Wish I had held her longer
Wish I had held her long

A gorgeous vagabond, she was sweet but she was strong
She was an American beauty
She was déjà vu, she was a catch-22
She was an American beauty

Her blue eyes shine in the summer sun
Her kiss felt like a loaded gun
Wish I had held her longer
Wish I had held her long

Goodbye came like the morning sun
She fired shots from a loaded gun
Wish I had held her longer
Wish I had held her long

She was a good companion
Eyes like the Grand Canyon
She was an American beauty
