No one came to take you
How could you leave?
Wrapped you in white paper
And sent you downstream

Found your mama in the basement in the cold
What does heaven know 'bout fool's gold?
Oh

There are nights I see you
In big sister's hazel eyes
She'll be looking out for you
Underneath the sapphire skies

Found your mama in the basement in the cold
What does heaven know 'bout fool's gold?
Oh

Found your mama in the basement in the cold
What does heaven know 'bout fool's gold?
Oh
