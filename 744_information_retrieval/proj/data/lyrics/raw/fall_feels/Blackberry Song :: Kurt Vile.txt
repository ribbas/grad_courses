Man I like your style
Make it last a little while
Put your self under the ground
And you come back around
I wanna see ya
Still the same

Girl your like a child
Your blackberries grow so wild
Pick the best ones off the bush
And relish and wish you were alright
Left
With lace 
With rightness

My beloved blackberry
My love for you floats free
Leave yourself in sound turn around
Sing me your blackberry song
