You give me a sign, you give me a lift
Take me home when I'm done my shift
You give me a loan when I'm stone cold broke
Get me high when I need a toke

I was born to love
I was born to
I was born to love
I was born to

Times were tough, we made it through
We tasted the rough, so let's savor the smooth
All the time I was hurting you
Got to believe that I was hurting, too

I was born to love
I was born to
Born to love
I was born to

You're the only one I can talk to
The only one I can really read
I know you give because you want to
Don't you think it's time you learn to let yourself receive?

Could make you smile, could make you sing
Just want to give back a little bit of what you've give to me
I could sing you a song, play you a tune
I know it's just a little thing, but it's something I can do

I was born to love
I was born to
I was born to love
I was born to

I was born to love you
I was born to love you
