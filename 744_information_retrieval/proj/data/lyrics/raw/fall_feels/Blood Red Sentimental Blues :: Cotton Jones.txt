I just thought I'd tell you
All the demons have been slayed
There's no need for hesitation
Honey, I've been rearranged
Now they've got me wonderin' what to do
Oh, the blood red sentimental blues

I heard it in the alleyway
You're strumming your guitar
Though I could hardly see your face
You've got a mouth all full of stars
You better spit 'em out now!

I just thought I'd tell you
All the demons have been slayed
For you'll only be as big as what you do
Over blood red sentimental blues

I heard it in the garbage can
In every piece of trash
You'd better color up my heart again
I'm afraid it's turning black
I could hear it in the alleyway
You're strumming your guitar
Though I could hardly see your face
You've got a mouth all full of stars

You better spit 'em out now
You better spit 'em out now

There's no need for hesitation
There's no need for hesitation
I heard it in the toilet bowl
You're calling out my name
