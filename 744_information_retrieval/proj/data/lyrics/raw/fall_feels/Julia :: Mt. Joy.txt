Straighten my sweater, fix my spine
Step up in line, I'm ordering food high
And I don't know why
I'm so nervous I won't make it
'Cause that's my favorite waitress
Those big brown eyes
I don't know what I ordered
But you're smiling like I can't afford it
Ooh

Addicted to TED talks
Waiting for lift off
But I didn't know it if it's doing much
'Cause I just lost my mind
In the fluorescent lights of my life
In my mind, a river running free like rabbits

But Julia
Fix me a blue sky in the world sun
And i'll be back now
Julia
How long, how long till I'm all gone?
'Cause here I am

Just stumbling down
Elysian Fields
A spanish moss
And a sudden feel
Silver moonlight in the trees
And the devil's in my bloodstream
Don't say you love the old me

Just stumbling down Elysian Fields
Your vision coming clear
And I don't know where home is
And the doors wide open

Julia
How long, how long, how long, oh lord, oh lord
Julia
How long, how long till it's all gone?
How long, how long?
'Cause you deserve a man to lead you in
But here I am just stumbling down Elysian Fields again
