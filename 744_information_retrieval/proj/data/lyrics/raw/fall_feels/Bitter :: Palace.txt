Lend me your brakes again, you're more than my speed
I've played heart strings before, but not in your key
You tell me you're waiting for someone, but you haven't heard, no
You've broken promises to me, so fuck your word
And again, and again, you're breaking me down
Let me in, let me in from the dark of this town

Why am I bitter, bitter, bitter?
Why am I always led astray?
It's gonna get better, better, better
I'd always hear you say

Tell me I'm great again, and I'll love you more
Ride high fake confidence, right down to my core
Strike a nerve like an airstrike raid, all under my skin
I'll wear a mask to cover myself, in the shape of a grin
And again, and again, you're breaking me down
Let me in, let me in from the dark of this town

Why am I bitter, bitter, bitter?
Why am I always led astray?
It's gonna get better, better, better
I've always heard you say
