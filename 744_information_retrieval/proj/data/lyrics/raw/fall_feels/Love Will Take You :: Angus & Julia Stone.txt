If we never found this love
If we never took that road
If we hadn't had the heart
We wouldn't have this home

Love, love will take you
Love, love will take you there
Love, love will take you
Love, love will take you there

In this world the heart beats slow
In my arms let's share the cold
In my eyes you're all I've known
Darlin' let's go home

Love, love will take you
Love, love will take you there
Love, love will take you
Love, love will take you there

Love, love will take you
Love, love will take you there
Love, love will take you
Love, love will take you there
