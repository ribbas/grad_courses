Say who are we to pretend
To know things we don't
And say who are we to neglect
Our vast horizons

To be at peace with and without
Knowledge and doubt
To be at peace with and without
Knowledge and doubt

To be at peace
With and without
To be at peace
With and without

To be at peace
To be at peace
To be at peace
To be at peace
