In the silver light
I just made out
Your silhouette
Through the quickening haze
So brand it on my mind
So I don't forget
Let it shine
On my wandering eyes

And ooh, your love endures
And ooh, I have faith for the rest

I'm blinded by the lights
Of October skies
These postcard memories
Evade my eyes
And in the valley I am free
But in the hills I soar
Until your silhouette
Is gone once more

And ooh, your love endures
Ooh, I have hope once more

The fear of what's to come
Has been crippling me
So to your silhouette
I turn once more
So brand it on my mind
So I won't forget
Let it shine
Let it shine
By my wandering eyes
Let it shine
Let it shine
By my wandering eye

Ooh, your love endures
Ooh, I have hope once more
