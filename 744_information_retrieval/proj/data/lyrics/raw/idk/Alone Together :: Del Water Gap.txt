I don't ever tell you nothing, no
I don't have the courage, do you mind it?
I've been superstitious at night now, I've been
More specifically I'm frightened

"Don't die," I said, "I won't," you repeat
I'm so in my head, my thumb's on your teeth
I'm coasting through life, you sold your twenties
Tell me, how did it happen?

Oh love, oh my my
Don't you find it moving how we're still alone
Still alone together
Oh love, oh my my
Don't you find it moving how we're still alone
Still alone together

Tell me what would you do for love
Now that you found it

Smoking, hanging off of my hand and coughing
"Do you wanna move in with me?"
You can do the crossword while I'm making breakfast
Don't tell me if you have to cheat

I'll try my best to keep you appeased
You're crying on my chest, I'm high on my knees
I'm so sad but I
Just don't make me leave
Fuck, how did this happen?

Oh love, oh my my
Don't you find it moving how we're still alone
Still alone together
Oh love, oh my my
Don't you find it moving how we're still alone
Still alone together

Tell me what would you do for love
Now that you found it
Yeah tell me what would you do for love
Now that you found it
Tell me what would you do

Don't you find it moving
Oh, don't you find it moving
Oh, don't you find it moving how we're still alone
