My character's breaking
Thought I had this memorized
It doesn't help that I'm wasted
With these lights right in my eyes
Why's it still feel like I'm taking
Center stage from someone else?
Why's it still feel like I'm faking
When I'm starring as myself?

Got three more hours back from LA
And my Nissan's breaking down
Grab a replacement on the way
Got money for it now
Welcome to spotlit vacation
Where the silence grows like trees
I'm fielding congratulations
While I'm choking on the leaves

Should I keep on searching? (Is this really all there is? I try)
I'm trying to turn in (What if I already did?)
To I, I'm trying
I'm trying

They say the mind's a good servant
As a master, it is fucked
Convinced it's gotta be perfect
No such thing as good enough
You got a head full of what ifs
And it's keeping you afloat
And you got better days coming
Doesn't mean they're tomorrow

Should I keep on searching? (Is this really all there is? I try)
I'm trying to turn in (What if I already did?)
To I, to I (If I already did, if I already did, I'm scared that I already did)
To try (I'm scared that I already did, I'm scared that I already did)
To try (I'm scared that I already did, I'm scared that I already did)
