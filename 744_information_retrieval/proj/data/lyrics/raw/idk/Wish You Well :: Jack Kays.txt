Do you remember
When we were younger
We would always say
That we would be together
Then everything changed
We went our separate ways
We never knew each other
Always thought it was strange
You never acted the same
When we would be with others
Always treated me different

I know it's been a long time since we last talked
But I wish you well, wish you well
I put your secrets in the vault in the back of my mind
I would never tell
Never thought it would end up like this when we were just kids
Now I'm someone else, someone else
I never thought it made sense to put all our faith
In a wishing well, wishing well

You wouldn't get it
All of this time
I was so focused on healing
But you don't do that
'Cause nobody taught you
To deal with your feelings
I should have known that
I could never expect you
To feel the way I do
I'd never go back
To the way that you're used to

I know it's been a long time since we last talked
But I wish you well, wish you well
I put your secrets in the vault in the back of my mind
I would never tell
Never thought it would end up like this when we were just kids
Now I'm someone else, someone else
I never thought it made sense to put all our faith
In a wishing well, wishing well
