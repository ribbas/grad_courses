I always wait for you to call me but you're never on time
And every night I'm on your old street, you're the one on my mind
But do they care, do they care like I do?
Maybe you can change your mind too

You should change, you should change, you should change your mind
You should change, you should change, you should change your mind
You should change, you should change, you should change your mind
You should change, you should change, you should change your mind

I never thought that you would tell me things you did on the side
But now I'm falling on our old street you're the one on my mind
But do they care, do they care like I do?
Maybe you can change your mind too

You should change, you should change, you should change your mind
You should change, you should change, you should change your mind
You should change, you should change, you should change your mind
('Cause I just wanna know)
You should change, you should change, you should change your mind
(Am I worth it)

I should let you go because I'm always on my own
I've been waiting for you to call me, running back to tell you I'm sorry, yeah
I should let you go because I'm always on my own
I've been waiting for you to call me, running back to tell you I'm sorry, yeah
I should let you go because I'm always on my own
I've been waiting for you to call me, running back to tell you I'm sorry, yeah
I should let you go because I'm always on my own
I've been waiting for you to call me, running back to tell you I'm sorry, yeah
