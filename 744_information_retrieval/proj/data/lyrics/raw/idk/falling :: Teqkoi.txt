Try it cause it feels right
I'm trying 'cause it feels nice
Falling on my face
Falling into place

When bodies fall down
Bodies never seem to go
When I fall down my heart
Just seems to explode

Try it cause it feels right
I'm trying 'cause it feels nice
Falling on my face
Falling into place

When bodies fall down
Bodies never seem to go
When I fall down my heart
Just seems to explode

Try it cause it feels right
I'm trying 'cause it feels nice
Falling on my face
Falling into place

When bodies fall down
Bodies never seem to go
When I fall down my heart
Just seems to explode

Hopeless
Creatures
We fall
Down

Try it cause it feels right
I'm trying 'cause it feels nice
Falling on my face
Falling into place

When bodies fall down
Bodies never seem to go
When I fall down my heart
Just seems to explode
