Take me, I'm getting impatient
Tired of waiting for you to say when, can it be over?
'Cause I'm breaking under this weight and I
Can't keep going any lower, I need closure

Nothing lasts forever
So when will this end?
I'm waiting for the day
I can't take much longer
Well, I wish that I was stronger
I'm scared I won't see 28

I try but I fail to see the good through this veil
That's covered up my eyes, everything I see's disguised
And I can't tell what's real, I try my best just to feel
But I've gone so numb, can't perceive anything
I've had enough of this never-ending nightmare
Someone help me, I'm scared I'll never wake up
Get me out of this fucking place
I'm sick and tired and I'm losing patience
Take me, I'm wasting away not to be seen again
Sleep until time comes to end

Nothing lasts forever
So when will this end?
I'm waiting for the day
I can't take much longer
Well, I wish that I was stronger
I'm scared I won't see 28
