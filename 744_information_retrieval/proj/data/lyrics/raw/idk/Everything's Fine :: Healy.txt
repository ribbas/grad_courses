Guess I'm alright
Haven't lashed out in such a long time
Closing my eyes helps hold my pride
Burned my hands a lil more than I'd like
Everything's fine

Guess I'm alright
Haven't lashed out in such a long time
Closing my eyes helps hold my pride
Burned my hands a lil more than I'd like
Everything's fine

Think I might die if I see my shadow one more time
Don't remind me I'm alive with lines of fire
I'm Fahrenheit
Everything's fine

Guess I've gone blind
How come you're so hard to find
5th dimension, Poltergeist
Eyes wide open every night
Everything's fine

Everything is
Outta my sight
Outta my mind

Everything is
Outta my sight
Outta my mind 

Guess I'm alright
Haven't lashed out in such a long time
Closing my eyes helps hold my pride
Burned my hands a lil more than I'd like
Everything's fine

Guess I'm alright
Haven't lashed out in such a long time
Closing my eyes helps hold my pride
Burned my hands a lil more than I'd like
Everything's fine

The memories fade
Am I made to break away?
The symmetry's safe
I wanna feel the friction, grip the grain

Bluejeans, Black Cat
Who's he? How's that?
Sprint streets, Sunset
Skip beats, backtrack
Gut speaks, talk back
New phone contact
Don't leave -
How fast is godspeed?
I'll match that

Headlights, flashback
Concrete, abstract
Life is a movie
This is the soundtrack
