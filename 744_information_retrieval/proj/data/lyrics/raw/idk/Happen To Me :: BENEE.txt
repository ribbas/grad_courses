Hope I don't die inside a plane
I'd like to die a better way
And if I live to an old age
I would've seen everything change

I understand why people leave
But leaving seems scary to me

I think about these things too much
My mind likes to wind itself up
And I don't get a lot of sleep
'Cause what if they happen to me?

'Cause what if they happen to me?
Yeah, what if they happen to me?

What if my room burns down in flames
And I die in my sleep and never wake?

You say I shouldn't be this way
But I don't think that I can change

I think about these things too much
My mind likes to wind itself up
And I don't get a lot of sleep
'Cause what if they happen to me?

'Cause what if they happen to me?
Yeah, what if they happen to me?

I think about these things too much
My mind likes to wind itself up
And I don't get a lot of sleep
'Cause what if they happen to me?
