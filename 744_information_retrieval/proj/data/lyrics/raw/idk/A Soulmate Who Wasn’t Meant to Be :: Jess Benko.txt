I never should have called
'Cause I knew you would leave me
But I didn't think you could do it so easily
And I never should have held your hand
On that cold rainy night
'Cause, further along, it would cause another fight

Stranger, that's all I see
When I look into your eyes
A soulmate who wasn't meant to be
Stranger, who knows all my secrets
Can pull me apart and break my heart
A soulmate who wasn't meant to be

I never should have kissed
Kissed your hand
I am under your control
I will never understand
I never should have said
"I love you"
You never said it back
So why do I still care for you?

Stranger, that's all I see
When I look into your eyes
A soulmate who wasn't meant to be
Stranger, who knows all my secrets
Can pull me apart and break my heart
A soulmate who wasn't meant to be

Wish I could go back to the day we met and leave you be
Sit and look pretty
Never should have called
Never should have helped
Never should have kissed
Never should have said

Stranger, that's all I see
When I look into your eyes
A soulmate who wasn't meant to be
Stranger, who knows all my secrets
Can pull me apart and break my heart
A soulmate who wasn't meant to be
