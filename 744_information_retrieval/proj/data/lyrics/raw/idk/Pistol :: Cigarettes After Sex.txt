Give me the pistol, aim it high
I'm out in the desert shooting at the sky
Guess I really miss you and I don't know what else to do

Beautiful pictures that you took of us
Used to hang up there on your bedroom walls
But you took them all down now and you put them into a drawer

You've been on my mind
You've been on my mind
You've been on my mind so long I can't deal with it

You've been on my mind
And I'll waste my time
'Til you lift me off the floor and love me again

I know if I saw you and we kissed just once
You could be happy, maybe you'd come back
'Cause I really miss you, don't know how much more I can take

You've been on my mind
You've been on my mind
You've been on my mind so long I can't deal with it

You've been on my mind
And I'll waste my time
'Til you lift me off the floor and love me again

'Til you lift me off the floor and love me again
