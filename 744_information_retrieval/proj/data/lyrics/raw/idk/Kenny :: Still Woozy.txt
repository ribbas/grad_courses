Don't pay me no mind, I'll be fine
I'll pull myself together this time

You're right when you're right, but I'm always wrong
You could never get to me, I'm always on all night
Leaving when it's light and I'm walking home
Talking to myself like I've been on the phone all night

Alright
I'll give you all I've got

Don't pay me no mind, I'll be fine
I'll pull myself together this time
I'll try to be someone who could hold up
Hold up alone
I'll try to be someone who could hold up
Hold up on their own

Took me more than a couple years
To see you around, it's nice to hear you're alright
Still have my trophies on the wall
Been a while since I went and outroped them all and that's alright (Alright)
Alright

I gave you all I got
I didn't know
I gave you all I had, so

Don't pay me no mind, I'll be fine
I'll pull myself together this time
I'll try to be someone who could hold up
Hold up alone
I'll try to be someone who could hold up
Hold up on their own
