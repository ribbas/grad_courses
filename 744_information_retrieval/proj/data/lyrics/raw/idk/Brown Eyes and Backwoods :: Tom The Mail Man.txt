Brown eyes and Backwoods
Who knew you'd be that good
Who knew you'd be hazardous
Tragic what happened we weren't
Meant to last for life
Brown eyes and Backwoods
Who knew you'd be that good
Who knew we'd be hella destructive
The bombs that we made blew our walls down

Laugh at the sky as they fall down
Crushing us under the ground now
The smiles that we had never vanished
Tried to find love but we panicked
Too much thinking
Never living in the moment
We were children
Always living for the season
When this summer's over it's fall winter end

Brown eyes and Backwoods
Who knew you'd be that good
Who knew you'd be hazardous
Tragic what happened we weren't
Meant to last for life
Brown eyes and Backwoods
Who knew you'd be that good
Who knew we'd be hella destructive
The bombs that we made blew our walls down

I wish we never fell down
But that's just how it goes
When it's raining and cold
It's easy to tell when it's over
We had our backs on the wall
I wish I could tell when it's worth time
At least I can say that you were mine

Brown eyes and Backwoods
Who knew you'd be that good
Who knew you'd be hazardous
Tragic what happened we weren't
Meant to last for life
Brown eyes and Backwoods
Who knew you'd be that good
Who knew we'd be hella destructive
The bombs that we made blew our walls down

Brown eyes and Backwoods
Who knew you'd be that good
Who knew you'd be hazardous
Tragic what happened we weren't
Meant to last for life
