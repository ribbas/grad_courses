Sun sets, we wander through a foreign town
Strangely, there's nobody else around
So you open your dress and show me your tits
On the swing set at the old playground

And when you go away, I still see you
The sunlight on your face in the rear view

Sun sets, I want to hear your voice
A love that nobody could destroy
Took photographs like Brautigan's book covers
That we both adored

And when you go away, I still see you
The sunlight on your face in my rear view
This always happens to me this way
Recurring visions of such sweet days

And when you go away, I still see you
The sunlight on your face in my rear view
When you go away, I still see you
The sunlight on your face in my rear view
