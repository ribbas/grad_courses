Yeah

What's so fucked up in my head?
Can't think straight, my mind is dead
Went too far, I went too deep
Wonder how you'll see me
My pride is bent, but I'll stand tall
What will it take? I'll pay it all
Lift this burden off my chest
Leave these words, just take the rest
What's so fucked up in my brain?
Can't think clear, I've gone insane
Told me not to lose my head
I just took it off instead
Fuck this day, week, month, year, life
Against these walls, my fists are tied
Don't wake me up, put me to bed
And when I'm gone, sing what I've said
