(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)

Are you still in love, my darlin'? (Ooh, ooh)
Did you fall out of love, my darlin'? (Ooh, ooh)

Fighting on and on and on and on and on and on for what? (Ooh, ooh)
I've been goin', goin', goin', goin', goin' on, my love (Ooh, ooh)
Through with it

Please don't run away
From me
My love, still stay
Don't leave
Are you cryin' out?
Can you hear me now?
I am here for you
I am here for you

Are you still in love, my darlin'? (Ooh, ooh, hello, hello, hello)
Did you fall out of love, my darlin'? (Ooh, ooh)

(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)

Jamie
Do you still love me?
Jamie
Why'd you go and leave?
And I'm finally lettin' you go
I'm finally lettin' you go
I'm finally lettin' you go
Lettin' my control

(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)
