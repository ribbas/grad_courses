Don't you wanna go to New York?
Don't you wanna stay with me
Don't you wanna feel for something more
And don't you wanna feel that with me

'Cause boy I was insecure
Always so immature
Heartbroken, I walked right into it

And I couldn't get out
But I'm out now

A little crisis at twenty-one
A little tragic, but it's said and done
And I guess that's the time to have it
I guess that's the time to break habits

Let some people down, really messed around
Taking bets around how Ihe'll feel about me when I get home
And dry eyes 'til I dried it on him

'Cause boy I was insecure
Always so immature
Heartbroken, I walked right into it
A stranger 'til her lies finished it

And I couldn't get out
But I'm out now
I just want you to stay for a while
I just want you to stay for a while
I just want you to stay for a while
I just want you to stay for a while

Life is what you make it
So don't you wanna live it
Oh, I would rather rest
But sometimes I feel
A hint of it
