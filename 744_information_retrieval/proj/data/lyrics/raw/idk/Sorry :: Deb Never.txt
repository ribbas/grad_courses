Oh no, look at all the damage you have done
I'm no different at all from you
You're a full speed, freight train crashing through my walls
I'm a passenger I'm stuck on you

Be the codeine morphine flowing through my veins
Just can't get enough
Get lifted, rocket ship
You're my outer space
I'm a passenger, I think I'm

Feeling small
Lose myself until I disappear
Do you feel tall?
Knowing you're the reason that I'm

Fucked up, black out drunk at another party
Big shit rock star, but I think you're boring
Now I'm gone, moved on, yeah I'm never sorry
I'm never sorry

Fucked up, black out drunk at another party
Big shit rock star, but I think you're boring
Now I'm gone, moved on, yeah I'm never sorry
I'm never sorry

Don't miss you much
Think I'm better off alone
Don't wanna find another you
Big words, act tough, thank God I cut the cord
Because I can't be tied to you

Oh I finally caught a break
Oh why do you look out of place?
Don't lie, you got a glass face
I can see it in your eyes, you're

Feeling small
Lose yourself until you disappear
Now I feel tall
Knowing I'm the reason that you're

Fucked up, black out drunk at another party
Big shit rock star, but I think you're boring
Now I'm gone, moved on, yeah I'm never sorry
I'm never sorry

Fucked up, black out drunk at another party
Big shit rock star, but I think you're boring
Now I'm gone, moved on, yeah I'm never sorry
I'm never sorry

Fucked up, black out drunk at another party
Big shit rock star, but I think you're boring
Now I'm gone, moved on, yeah I'm never sorry
I'm never sorry
