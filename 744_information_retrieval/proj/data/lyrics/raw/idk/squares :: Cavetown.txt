All I see is squares
Ones and zeros in the air
Not sure how I got here
Is anybody there?
Something draws me to a tree
Compelled to punch the blocks
Somehow it doesn't hurt me
I'm stronger than I thought

Am I really alone?
Am I the only one?
I should build a home
Before the sun is gone
Punch a two by one
Tunnel in the ground
Make a couple doors
With the wood I found
