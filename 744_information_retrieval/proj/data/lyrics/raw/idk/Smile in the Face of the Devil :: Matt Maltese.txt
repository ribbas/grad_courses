It's been a bad run, you've had some bad tries
It's a small life, you're a horsefly
Lost up a big tree, out the beasts reach
But you'll be ok in this dark place

All you gotta do is shift your upper lip and smile
In the face of the devil, smile

Good things happen to the bad ones
But you're a tortoise and they've got bad hair
Attached to the motherboard, we all get bored
Thinking bad things, stop thinking bad things

All gotta do is shift your upper lip and smile
In the face of the devil
Smile in the face of the devil
Smile in the face of the devil
Smile in the face of the devil
Smile, smile
Smile, smile
Ah
