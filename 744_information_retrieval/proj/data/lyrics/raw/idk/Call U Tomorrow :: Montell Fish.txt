Can I call you, you tomorrow?
Can I call you, you tomorrow?

Hear me out
Maybe this is it
The death of us
I'm crying out
God, hear my prayer
Maybe there's no ending us
You hear our cry

And if I mean something
If I still mean something to you
I'm still here
And if I mean something
If I still mean something to you
I'm still here

So, can I call you, you tomorrow?
Can I call you, you tomorrow?
Can I call you, you tomorrow? (I don't really wanna speak to you no more, yeah, yeah)
Can I call you, you tomorrow?

Can I call you, you tomorrow?
Can I call you, you tomorrow?
Can I call you, you tomorrow?
Can I call you, you tomorrow?
Can I call you, you tomorrow? (If God is all I have, then God is all I need)
Can I call you, you tomorrow? (Thoughts inside my mind will sweep right over me)
