I'm a little alike you before, things had changed
Inner compass aligned, all this feels rearranged

Tell me, does it matter
If I'm still here, or I'm gone?
Shifting to the after
An imposter, I'm not the one you know

I look the same outside
Nearly me, even though
I carry something I hide
Underneath the one you know

Tell me, does it matter
If I'm still here, or I'm gone?
Shifting to the after
An imposter, soldiers on

Are you surprised
Black water flows
From wells run dry
I'm not the one you know

Lay me out with flowered guilt
Watch the explosions falling
Cannot live within this tilt
Carrying over
I'm not the one you know

Tell me, does it matter
If I'm still here, or I'm gone?
Shifting to the after
An imposter, soldiers on

Are you surprised
Black water flows
From wells run dry
I'm not the one you know
I'm not the one you know
