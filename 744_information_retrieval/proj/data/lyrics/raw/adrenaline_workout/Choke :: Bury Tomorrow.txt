Sick of hiding the truth
Fucking lying to you
No more time left for hope
At the end of your rope

Choke, at the end of your rope
Choke

No more running, no more hiding, from tomorrow
Living life without your eyes, hollow

Read between the lines
More than meets the eye, A face so pure
He's insecure
He's been running for some time

Find me trapped inside my head
(I can't find a way to bring myself back)
Choking on these words unsaid
(Spit it out, spit it out before I fade out)

Sick of hiding the truth
Fucking lying to you
No more time left for hope
At the end of your rope

We are bleeding underneath, I see your shadow
Below the surface I am taken, by your sorrow

Read between the lines
More than meets the eye, A face so pure
He's insecure
He's been running for some time

Find me trapped inside my head
(I can't find a way to bring myself back)
Choking on these words unsaid
(Spit it out, spit it out before I fade out)

Eternal ache
A silent grave
Eternal

Find me trapped inside my head
(I can't find a way to bring myself back)
Choking on these words unsaid
(Spit it out, spit it out before I fade out)

Buried in my own head, falling apart
Choking on my own tongue, tearing my heart'
