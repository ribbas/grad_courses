Incite a riot, put yourself in a trance
You rotate the frame in a world you rely on
A scar, a line has been drawn in the sand
Behold the life, the boundaries fools will crush

The greatest miracle
Is burning to the ground

Onto the next stage of the plan
Mourn the witness of the wind
A handful of thunder
Will rise one last time

There's fire in the sky
You're in the Amazon
The greatest miracle
Is burning to the ground

Godly Amazonia
Bloody Amazonia
Mighty Amazonia
Killing Amazonia
Godly Amazonia
Bloody Amazonia
Mighty Amazonia
Killing Amazonia
Godly Amazonia
Bloody Amazonia

Burn the land
Learn the end

Burn
Another gold mine is unveiled
The source of our sorrow
Learn
Embedded in these walls of green
Is the curse that we follow

There's fire in the sky
You're in the Amazon
The greatest miracle
Is burning to the ground
