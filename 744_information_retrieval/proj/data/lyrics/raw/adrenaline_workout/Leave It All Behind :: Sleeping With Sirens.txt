When you look at my life
Tell me what do you see?
I'm only human
So don't expect too much from me

I lost my faith, what have I become?
I don't think I can be safe from what I'm running from

Will you remember me if I
Were to fall into the sky?
And what will they think of me
If I leave it all behind?
When I leave it all behind

Would you be so surprised
If I gave up tonight?
I'm barely breathing
I wanna kill the pain I feel inside

But I won't quit for the people I love
So I'll say I'm fine until the day I fuckin' see the light

Will you remember me if I
Were to fall into the sky?
And what will they think of me
If I leave it all behind?
When I leave it all behind

If you feel like you are nothing
If you feel like letting go
I'll be your hope when you are hopeless
Together we are not alone

You're not alone!

Will you remember me if I
Were to fall into the sky?
(Fall into the sky)
And what will they think of me
(Think of me)
If I leave it all behind?
When I leave it all behind
Yeah
