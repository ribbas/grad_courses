Open up, drink it in, don't ask too many questions
Become the vessel for the shame they feed you through suggestion
There's a rumor on the breeze, secrets that bring you to your knees
We made the problem, we are the poison, woah oh

Close your eyes, surrender your beliefs to them for holding
Wait patiently to hear what ever-changing lines are showing
There's a whisper on the wind, eventual storm that's rolling in
They have the answers, cure for the cancer, we've become that we've become

But all they wanted was violence
To plant their seeds and divide us
If they want the worst that's inside us
Well, bring on the violence, the violence

Back and forth, daily take apart what you've been building
Everything you have is to be fed into the system
There's a force out pushing fear, a deafening silence drawing near
Sit and absorb it, guess we've been toxic all along, all along

All they wanted was violence
To plant their seeds and divide us
If they want the worst that's inside us
Well, bring on the violence, the violence
(The violence)
To plant their seeds and divide us
(The violence)
If they want the worst that's inside us
(The violence)
Well, bring on the violence, the violence

I'm on the edge, and I'm not alone
Remember this is what you asked for
I'm on the edge, and I'm not alone
Remember this is what you asked for

All you wanted was violence
To plant your seeds and divide us
You want the worst that's inside us
Well, bring on the violence, the violence
(The violence)
We'll fall before you divide us
(The violence)
If you want the worst that's inside us
(The violence)
Bring on the violence, the violence
