It's all falling down around me
The last grain of sand slipping through the hourglass
And it can be so overwhelming
Like racing to a red light
Someone cut the brake lines

Nothing's making sense
I'm running out of breath
My heart is beating faster and faster
It's happening again
The walls are closing in
I'm trying to hold on, but it feels like the end

Cue the curtain call, roll the credits, it's over
Death is creeping in and it's never been closer
All the violins won't make us sink slower
Put me in the ground, throw the flowers, it's over

The last time, it almost killed me
I could see myself drifting through the afterlife
And from hell I saw my body lifeless
Flat on my back, tied up to the train tracks

Nothing's making sense
I'm running out of breath
My heart is beating faster and faster
It's happening again
The walls are closing in
I'm trying to hold on, but it feels like the end

Cue the curtain call, roll the credits, it's over
Death is creeping in and it's never been closer
All the violins won't make us sink slower
Put me in the ground, throw the flowers, it's over

Take me out of this world
Where trust is corruption
I'll always be the pariah
So give me death and destruction

I smashed it all into pieces
Rolled in the glass till I bled
This whole ride was just a headrush
Drop the flowers, I'm dead

Nothing's making sense
I'm running out of breath
I'm trying to hold on, but it feels like the end

Cue the curtain call, roll the credits, it's over
Death is creeping in and it's never been closer
All the violins won't make us sink slower
Put me in the ground, throw the flowers, it's over
