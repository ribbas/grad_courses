We fell into the abyss
Eyes open wide
To chase a trivial fix
All the way to Hell
Now we awaken to this
Hearts broken die
How do we lay it to rest?
Time will only tell

I feel your burn
Lighting us to home
Calling to return
Before we go

Heaven don't you cry
We will find the rest in time

Another soul to the sand
God help us try
To see the sorrow at hand
Desperation kills
Before we falter again
Wake to this night
How do we make our amends
Sacrifice our will

I feel your burn
Lighting us to home
Calling to return
Before we go

Heaven don't you cry
We will find the rest in time
Hope will draw the line
To a place beyond resign

Heaven don't you cry
We will find the rest in time
Hope will draw the line
To a place beyond resign

Heaven don't you cry
We will find the rest in time
Hope will draw the line
To a place beyond resign
