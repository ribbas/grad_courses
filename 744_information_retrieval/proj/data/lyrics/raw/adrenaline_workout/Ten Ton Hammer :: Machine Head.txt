i am the thing that makes you sick
i am the blame that gets placed quick
detect the crack within your lie
i'll be the wrath of your disdain
i'll be the fear in you ingrained
become the facts that you deny

[chorus:]
i can feel this pain is real
i hate deep down inside
and like broken glass you'll shatter
with bloody fists i'll batter
like a ten ton hammer son

i'll be the trembling in your breath
trickle of blood upon your flesh
you'd love to watch me take the fall
i'll be the thing that you despise
cause i'm a be there standing tall

[chorus]

i can't stand or take another day my friend
you could learn a thing or two

[chorus]
