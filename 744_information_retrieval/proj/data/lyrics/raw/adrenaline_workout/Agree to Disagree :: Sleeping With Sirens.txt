Come on!

Maybe I should care a little more about what everybody thinks
But I just don't have the time for nobody but me
The mood I'm in keeps changing like the weather
So you can keep the sun 'cause I like the night time better

You think you're better than me
You don't like what you see
I think it's best we agree to disagree
I'm doing fine by myself
I never asked for your help
I think it's best we agree to disagree

I wear my heart on my sleeve like a worn out sweater
But with a needle and some thread I've been keeping it together
Life's too short to be worried 'bout whatever
So you keep shining in the sun but I like the night time better
Yeah...

You think you're better than me
You don't like what you see
I think it's best we agree to disagree
I'm doing fine by myself
I never asked for your help
I think it's best we agree to disagree

You think I'm wrong
(You think I'm wrong)
It doesn't make you right
(It doesn't make you right)
And now there's no crossing the line
Stay on your own side

You think you're better than me
You don't like what you see
I think it's best we agree to disagree
I'm doing fine by myself
I never asked for your help
I think it's best we agree to disagree
Agree to disagree
Agree to disagree
