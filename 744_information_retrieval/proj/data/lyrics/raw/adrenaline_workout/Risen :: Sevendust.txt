Turn round, come down
Been stealing, feeling from me
Burned down, no sound
Been killing the life within me
Step down, last round
Live hating, loving memory
Break down, we drown

To turn around is everything
It all comes down to what it takes to love

If I fall would you pick me up?
Or kick me down again?
(Would you stay there with me)
If I tell you my deepest thoughts
Would you hear me out?
And help me rise again?

Not long, so gone
We shame your useless pity
You failed us all
Keep spewing the shit you tell me
Fall down so proud
Love hating, living memory
Erase you now

To turn around is everything
It all comes down to what it takes to love

If I fall would you pick me up?
Or kick me down again?
(Would you stay there with me)
If I tell you my deepest thoughts
Would you hear me out?
And help me rise again?

If I fall would you pick me up?
Or kick me down again?
(Would you stay there with me)
If I tell you my deepest thoughts
Would you hear me out?
And help me rise again?

If I fall would you pick me up?
Or kick me down again?
(Would you stay there with me)
If I tell you my deepest thoughts
Would you hear me out?
And help me rise again?
