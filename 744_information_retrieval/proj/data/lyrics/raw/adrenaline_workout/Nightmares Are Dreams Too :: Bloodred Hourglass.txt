Right here, right now
Nightmares are dreams too

You know, the smartest know they know nothing
Idle hands are the Devil's play things
So what have you really earned to preach
When I ask you nothing at all?

If anything misleads, it's truth
But mostly all I know of you
Is the less you speak
The more I listen to

Message of hope that's wrapped in sadness
Return to sender
Different stories with endless glory

Right here, right now
I will leave you far behind
Right here, right now
I believe the one inside

Broken trust, it's running on fumes
So feed me with something new
Before this is me against myself
Making space for my new mistakes

Message of hope that's wrapped in sadness
Return to sender
Different stories on endless stories

Prove me wrong
Nightmares are dreams too
Prove me wrong
Nightmares are dreams too

(Hey, you)

Right here, right now
I will leave you far behind
Right here, right now
I believe the one inside

It's only lies that I bust in your life
Could you prove me innocent while
It's only life that you chose to disguise?
So could you prove me innocent?

Doom me, prove me wrong
Nightmares are dreams too
Prove me wrong
Nightmares are dreams too
Nightmares are dreams too
