I know that we're only elements imbalancing
Go put the mirror down
We give everything just to seem innocent
Negative energy consumes
Breathe
Breathe
Breathe

Breathe

Hysteria
The consequence of fear
Hysteria
There's no way out of here

I'm so over this
I wanna snuff the wick
I'm fucking done with it
Ask no questions hear no lies
Life is just a gateway drug
But what's left in it for us?

It goes like
I don't want it
Just cos you have it
I don't want it
Fuck you're systematic
I don't want it
Just cos you have it
No doubt about it
I don't want your bullshit
Fuck you're systematic

I'm shook
Never should've given a fuck
We're just giving it up like it's dead to us
I'm shook
Bend the lie, it will all be over soon enough

Life is just a gateway drug
It's unconditional lust

It goes like
I don't want it
Just cos you have it
I don't want it
Fuck you're systematic
I don't want it
Just cos you have it
No doubt about it
I don't want your bullshit
Fuck you're systematic

I know that we're only elements imbalancing
Go put the mirror down
We give everything just to seem innocent
Negative energy consumes

I'm so over this
Never give up, never give in
Never gonna let the negative energy win
Never give up, never give in
Never let the negative consume
I'm so over this
I'm so over this
I'm so over this
