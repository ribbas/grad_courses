("I'm tryna fuckin' record this")
("Sorry")

I've got a shotgun tongue
And tick like a time bomb
All black everything
I've got a switchblade wit
That cuts like a bitch
And I think you two should meet

I wanna break free from my humanity
I wanna release the animal in me
B-b-b-break free [from] your curiosity
You're gonna give me what I need

I've got blood on my hands, no guilt on my conscience
The war in your path, the "sex in your violence"
All of my flaws, I wear 'em with honor
A purple heartbreak for all we've suffered

I am the enemy
I am the enemy
I am the enemy
Here to save the day
I'll be the enemy
E-e-e-enemy
I'll be the enemy
Enemy, enemy

I got a brand new
I got a brand new
I got a brand new
Brand new numb

I'm in your blind-spot, God while I get your rocks off, worship to the beat
I wanna thank you, come again, that was great, do you need a receipt?

I wanna break free from my humanity
I wanna release the darker side of me
B-b-b-break free [from] your curiosity
You're gonna give me what I need

Yeah I've still got blood on my hands, no guilt on my conscience
The war in your path, the "sex in your violence"
All of my flaws, I wear 'em with honor
A purple heartbreak for all we've suffered

I am the enemy
I am the enemy
I am the enemy
Here to save the day
I'll be the enemy
E-e-e-enemy
I'll be the enemy
Enemy, enemy

I got a brand new
I got a brand new
I got a brand new
Brand new numb
I got a brand new
I got a brand new
I got a brand new
Brand new numb

Give me liberty or death
Charge me more and pay me less
I said give me liberty or death
Ah fuck it, just give me death

(Let's go! Yeah!)
This one's for the underdogs

I've got blood on my hands, no guilt on my conscience
The war in your path, your mind is the target
All of my flaws, I wear 'em with honor
A purple heartbreak for all we've suffered

I am the enemy
I am the enemy
I am the enemy
Brand new numb
I'll be the enemy
E-e-e-enemy
I'll be the enemy
Brand new numb!
