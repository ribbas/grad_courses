Walk in the coals, I'm seeing red
I feel the heat in my head
There's so much smoke, I cannot see
The fire's raging at my face

Get me out of hell
Hey, hey, hey
Get me out of hell
Hey, hey, hey

We do what we have to
To be who we want to
Let them all doubt you
Walkin' the wire
Trial by fire

The ash is rising to my face
The fire's blazing around me

Get me out of hell
Hey, hey, hey
Get me out of hell
Hey, hey, hey

We do what we have to
To be who we want to
Let them all doubt you
Walkin' the wire
Trial by fire

Trial by fire

We do what we have to
To be who we want to
Let them all doubt you
Walkin' the wire
Trial by fire
Trial by fire (We do what we have to)
(To be who we want to)
Trial by fire
Trial by fire
