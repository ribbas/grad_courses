I wouldn't be angry if you'd just fucking cry
Your tears would arouse me refreshing my supply
The suffering is fading, I scream into the sky
Repulsion invades me, I'll say goodbye

Digging deep inside of me
Getting past this agony
I can't seem to get away
Another day rotting in vain

I wouldn't be angry if things would stay the same
You're fighting, the torment, that helps me feed my pain
The suffering is fading, I scream into the sky
Repulsion invades me, I'll say goodbye

Digging deep inside of me
Getting past this agony
I can't seem to get away
Another day rotting in vain

I can't hear this
I hate [scatting]
I can't fuck this
I hate [scatting]
I can't take this
I hate [scatting]

Digging deep inside of me
Getting past this agony
I can't seem to get away
Another day rotting in ...

Digging deep inside of me
Getting past this agony
I can't seem to get away
Another day rotting in vain
