Let me address this to the people who bought my hits
It ain't tricky when you got it I ain't got shit
You have what you like I ain't see ya bitch
I just another nigga that's trying to get rich
I address this to the G's that brought my tracks when ya
See me out in public shake my head give me doubt
Some of ya like love wanna hug and kiss nigga's
But I don't kiss men I ain't lil Wayne nigga
I'm real hip hop they fakers and posers
They fakers and posers it'll all be over
I'm tired of wearing same shoes and the same clothes
I came to crush egos fighting choke holds

I came in this game with a grudge
If rappers don't like me I don't give a fuck
I ain't here friends bitch I'm here to make bucks
Earn my respect give the people what they want

I came in this game with a grudge
If rappers don't like me I don't give a fuck
I ain't here friends bitch I'm here to make bucks
Earn my respect give the people what they want

This song right here I address to the people
That know hyro is the mother fucking hero
They listen to me preach and they spread
My gospel these artists really beast I'm the
Mother fucking monster I address it to the
Rappers with the chains and glitter come
Around my hood and get ya burnt nigga
With these fairy tale rappers with these fairy
Tale names gold and diamonds we suppose to
Be afraid that shit is Disney channel that shit is
Nickelodeon my flow is dynamite something like
Napoleon bullet we be holding them but I don't
Need a bullet I fight like Brue Leu they shoot out like a bullet

I came in this game with a grudge
If rappers don't like me I don't give a fuck
I ain't here friends bitch I'm here to make bucks
Earn my respect give the people what they want

I came in this game with a grudge
If rappers don't like me I don't give a fuck
I ain't here friends bitch I'm here to make bucks
Earn my respect give the people what they want

So what up if ya got a problem nigga what's up?
Cause I know how to get the motherfucker pumped nigga get pumped
In the ghetto storm is that what you want

I came in this game with a grudge
If rappers don't like me I don't give a fuck
I ain't here friends bitch I'm here to make bucks
Earn my respect give the people what they want

I came in this game with a grudge
If rappers don't like me I don't give a fuck
I ain't here friends bitch I'm here to make bucks
Earn my respect give the people what they want
