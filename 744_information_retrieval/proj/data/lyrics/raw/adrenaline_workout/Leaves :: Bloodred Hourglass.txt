Did you ever really try
To figure out which you said you might
Or only separated our serenades?
Did you ever really try
To figure out what is left inside
Or only saved it for another time?

I cannot save your soul
I cannot watch you go
I cannot save your soul
Oh, how I wish I could just say so
All that we ever fought for
All the love that we fell for
I just cannot fight in every war
To find a way to carry on

I figured out which you said I might
Oh, maybe we could try another lives
Did you ever really find anything that we left behind?
Now could you find the time to say one more goodbye?
Can you still remember
Catching the falling leaves of our tree?
If you could change the day now
Is it one more day away from me
Or one more for me?

All that we ever fought for
All the love that we fell for
I cannot save your soul
I cannot save your soul
Oh, how I wish I could just say so
All that we ever fought for
All the love that we fell for
I just cannot fight in every way
To find a way to carry on

It's all now gone
We lived the life for, we paid the price for
We lived the life for, we paid the price for
We lived the life for, we paid the price for
(It's all now gone)

All that we ever fought for
All the love that we fell for
I cannot save your soul
I cannot save your soul
Oh, how I wish I could just say so
All that we ever fought for
All the love that we fell for
I just cannot fight in every way
To find a way to carry on
