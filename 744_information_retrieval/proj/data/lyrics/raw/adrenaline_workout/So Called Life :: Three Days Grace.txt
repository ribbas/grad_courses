Can't laugh, can't cry, can't live, can't die
Can't do anything anymore, no
Can't love, can't breathe, can't talk, can't sleep
But I can't seem to stay awake anymore, oh

What a time to be alive
Such a waste of fucking time

Oh, gimme something to take the edge off
Something to kick the night off
Something to keep my mind off
This so called life
Oh, gimme something to take the edge off
Something to kick the night off
Something to keep my mind off
This so called life

Feels like I wanna jump
Wanna scream, wanna run
Wanna fucking put a chainsaw through the wall, yeah
Feels like I'm living in a world where everybody's all for none
And none for all, yeah

What a time to be alive
Such a waste of fucking time

Oh, gimme something to take the edge off
Something to kick the night off
Something to keep my mind off
This so called life
Oh, gimme something to take the edge off
Something to kick the night off
Something to keep my mind off
This so called life

What a time to be alive
What a time to be alive
What a time to be alive
Such a waste of fucking time

Feels like I wanna jump
Wanna scream, wanna run
Wanna fucking put a chainsaw through the wall

Oh, gimme something
Oh, gimme something

Oh, gimme something to take the edge off
Something to kick the night off
Something to keep my mind off
This so called life
Oh, gimme something to take the edge off
Something to kick the night off
Something to keep my mind off
This so called life
