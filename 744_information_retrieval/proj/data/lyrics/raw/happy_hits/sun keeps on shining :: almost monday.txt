SYeah, I hopped up on my bike for a cruise around the town
When I saw a cute couple, they were sitting making out
My girlfriend has that jacket so I stopped and turned around like
("Ahh!") I'm sad now

But the sun keeps on shining
Yeah, the sun keeps on shining

Yeah

When I got back to my car trying to blow off all the steam
I was digging through my pockets and I couldn't find my keys
And I saw a parking ticket it was staring back at me like
("Ahh!") I'm broke now

But the sun keeps on shining
And the car keeps on driving
You can sit at home or you can take a ride
You can get a tan or stay inside
But the sun keeps on shining (Woo-ooh)

Now I'm down on all my luck so I scraped out all my change
Bought myself a ticket and I jumped up on a plane
Landed in Hawaii but my luggage never came
Oh no (No!) a heatwave

So then I walked up to the road with my thumb up in the air
Hoping that help would come but everybody just stared
A yellow jeep pulled over and I saw to my despair
(No!) My ex was here

But the sun keeps on shining
And the car keeps on driving
I'm looking for lemon but they gave me a lime
The days are getting harder but I'm still alive
And the sun keeps on shining (Ooh-ooh)

Ooh, ooh, ooh (Yeah)
(Sun keeps on shining)
Oo-oo-ooh, ooh, ooh (Yeah)

'Cause the sun keeps on shining
Yeah, the sun keeps on shining
You can stay at home or you can take a ride
You can get a tan or stay inside
But the sun keeps on shining (Oowee)

Ooh, ooh, ooh
(Alright, sun keeps on shining)
Oo-oo-ooh, ooh, ooh (Yeah)
Ooh, ooh, ooh
(It keeps on shining, baby)
Oo-oo-ooh, ooh, ooh
(Yeah, it shine, shi-shi-shine, it keeps on shining)
