Don't I make it look easy, baby
When I do what I do? (Uh, huh)
Don't I make it look easy, baby? Ah, ah
Well, I'm fooling you

I just posted a picture, read all the comments
Are these the good ones? If I'm being honest, uh huh, uh
I might've spent an hour on it
Sho, ah, pa, pa, sha, uh, ah, pa, pa, sha, uh (Mhm)

You won't ever see me cry (I'm not crying)
'Cause I've got a filter for every single lie

Don't I make it look easy, baby (Uh, huh)
When I do what I do? (When I do what I do)
Don't I make it look easy, baby? Ah, ah (Ah, ah, ah)
Well, I'm fooling you

I'm good at keeping my cool (Good at keeping my cool)
Don't I make it look easy, baby? Ah, ah (Ah, ah, ah)
Well, I'm fooling you

You think I live the lavish life, happy life
But you don't know I'm up all night
Worrying 'bout my body type
I wonder if I'm what they like
But I should just say fuck it, right?
Sho, ah, pa, pa, sha, uh, ah, pa, pa, sha, uh (Mhm)

And you won't ever see me cry (I'm not crying)
'Cause I've got a filter for every single lie

Don't I make it look easy, baby (Uh, huh)
When I do what I do? (When I do what I do)
Don't I make it look easy, baby? Ah, ah (Ah, ah, ah)

I know I ain't the only one who feels like this
Getting good (Getting good) at hiding all this mess
I'm tired (She's tired)
Oh, Lord, I'm tired (Yeah, she's tired)

Don't I make it look easy, baby (Uh, huh)
When I do what I do? (When I do what I do)
Don't I make it look easy, baby? Ah, ah (Ah, ah, ah)
Well, I'm fooling you
