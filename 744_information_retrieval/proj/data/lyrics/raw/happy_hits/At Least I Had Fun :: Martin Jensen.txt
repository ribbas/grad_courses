Stuck in a daydream, in paradise
That summer feeling, oh-oh-oh
Don't need no reason, just living life
No time for sleeping

So we broke some hearts and we danced on cars
All night long
Went to every bar, underneath the stars
One by one
You told me to grow up
But I can't just help myself
Maybe I'm messed up
And maybe I need some help

Yeah, I woke up with a headache and my memory's all gone
And I spent all of my money on martinis and rum
Now I only got one dollar till the end of the month
Should be sorry but not sorry

At least I had fun
At least I had fun
At least I had fun
At least I had fun

Had good intentions, guess it went wrong
But I ain't tripping, no-oh

So we broke some hearts and we danced on cars
All night long

Yeah, I woke up with a headache and my memory's all gone
And I spent all of my money on martinis and rum
Now I only got one dollar till the end of the month
Should be sorry but not sorry

At least I had fun
At least I had fun
At least I had fun
At least I had fun

At least I had fun
At least I had fun
At least I had fun
