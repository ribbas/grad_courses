Down south, hood baby (Hood baby)
Make all the girls go crazy (Ah)
Go (Go)
Go (Go)
Go stupid
But you smart like an A-plus student

Up, down, right, down
Looking for your love right now
La-la-la-la
Up, down, all around
Turn my stomach upside down
La-la-la-la

I found your hair-tie in my car
I could only drive so far without a breakdown (Ah)
Baby, you're the queen of hearts
You know how to play your cards, you keep 'em face-down (Ah)
Ooh, I miss your face now
Lookin' at your pictures, scrollin' way down (Ah)
Wishing I could fix all my mistakes
I wish I could erase you
Girl, I can't replace
You're the one that got away (Ooh)

Girl, your energy
Feels so heavenly
Make me feel like
La-la-la-la
You a melody
Put to memory
It goes something like
La-la-la-la
