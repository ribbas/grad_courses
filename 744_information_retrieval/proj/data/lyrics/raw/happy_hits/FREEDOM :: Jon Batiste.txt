When I move my body just like this
I don't know why
But I feel like freedom (Freedom)
I hear a song that takes me back
And I let go with so much freedom (Freedom)
Free to live (How I wanna live)
I'm gon' get (What I'm gonna get)
'Cause it's my freedom (Freedom)

I love how you talk
You speaking my language
The way that you walk
You can't contain it
Is it the shoes
Jumped up, kangaroo
We're overdue for a little more prancing

Now it's your time
(It's your right)
You can shine
(It's alright)
If you do
I'ma do too

When I move my body just like this
I don't know why
But I feel like freedom (Freedom)
I hear a song that takes me back
And I let go
With so much freedom (Freedom)
Free to live (How I wanna live)
I'm gon' get (What I'm gonna get)
'Cause it's my freedom (Freedom)

The reason we get down, is to get back up
If someone's around, go on let them look
You can't stand still
This ain't no drill
More than cheap thrills (Feels like money, money, money)

Now it's your time
(It's your right)
You can shine
(It's alright)
If you do
I'ma do too

'Cause when I look up to the stars (Stars)
I know exactly who we are (Ooh)
'Cause then I see you shine
You shinin'
You shinin' oh!

Free to be!
(Everybody come on) (Freedom!)
(Everybody come 'round)
(Everybody come on)
Come on now
(Everybody)

I'm stuck to the dance floor
With the, with the whole tape
With the, with the, with the whole tape
(Let me see you wobble)
I'm stuck to the dance floor
With the, with the whole tape
With the, with the, with the whole tape
(Let me see you shake)
Give you just what you ask for
Givin' you the whole shake
I'ma give you the whole shake
(Let me see you wobble)
I'm stuck to the dance floor
With the, with the whole tape
With the, with the, with the whole tape
(Can you make it break?)

I say yeah (Yeah)
Oh yeah (Oh yeah)
(Let me see you wobble)
'Cause, you do
I'ma do too

Come on now
(Everybody)

I'm stuck to the dance floor
With the, with the whole tape
With the, with the, with the whole tape
(Let me see you wobble)
I'm stuck to the dance floor
With the, with the whole tape
With the, with the, with the whole tape
(Let me see you shake)
Give you just what you ask for
Givin' you the whole shake
I'ma give you the whole shake
(Let me see you wobble)
I'm stuck to the dance floor
With the, with the whole tape
With the, with the, with the whole tape
(Can you make it break?)

I say yeah (Yeah)
Oh yeah (Oh yeah)
