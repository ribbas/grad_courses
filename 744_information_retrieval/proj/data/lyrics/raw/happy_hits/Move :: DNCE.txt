All I'm tryna do is make you get up out that chair and make you move, make you move
Grab that drink and meet me on the dancefloor, baby, let's get crazy, move, baby, move

I could barely see my fingers
High enough of Vertigo
All the good shit lingers
Yeah, you know
Like water through my body
Like river through the sand of time
To waste a moment with you would be a stupid crime
Oh, yeah

She tryna tell me something
She talkin' with her body
She makin' waves inside this room, room, room
We onto something major
Just let the feeling take you
Like it or not, might be leavin' with a stranger

All I'm tryna do is make you get up out that chair and make you move, make you move
Grab that drink and meet me on the dancefloor, baby, let's get crazy, move, baby, move
When you move like this, I can tell you a star
When you move like that, wanna buy you a car (Yeah, yeah)
All I'm tryna do is make you get up out that chair and make you move, make you move

You can tell me how you want it
We can take it fast or take it slow
Fly you to Aruba or Mexico
I'm clearin' up my calendar
All the days that end with "Y"
To waste a moment with you would be a stupid crime
Oh, yeah

She tryna tell me something
She talkin' with her body
She makin' waves inside this room, room, room
We onto something major
Just let the feeling take you
Like it or not, might be leavin' with a stranger

All I'm tryna do is make you get up out that chair and make you move, make you move
Grab that drink and meet me on the dancefloor, baby, let's get crazy, move, baby, move
When you move like this, I can tell you a star
When you move like that, wanna buy you a car (Yeah, yeah)
All I'm tryna do is make you get up out that chair and make you move, make you move

All I'm tryna do is make you get up out that chair and make you move, make you move
