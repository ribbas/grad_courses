She new to California, she know that I adore her
She got me like, "Ooh, I don't know what to do"
Sweet tea like Arizona, one look and I'm a goner
You're looking at me while they're looking at you
(Okay, okay)

I know she came here for me
I know she'll get it for free
She got 'em wrapped around her fingers
Got 'em down on them knees
She like a wave on the beach
She like a hundred degrees
Yeah, she made me a believer
She like heaven on me

Ooh, baby, is it you, baby?
Nah, this party isn't really my vibe (My vibe)
It's cool, baby, I got you, baby
And I know you're leaving with me tonight

She new to California, she know that I adore her
She got me like, "Ooh, I don't know what to do"
Sweet tea like Arizona, one look and I'm a goner
You're looking at me while they're looking at you

All eyes on you
Ah-ah-ah, ooh, oh-oh-ooh
All eyes on you
Ah-ah-ah, ooh, oh-oh-ooh
All eyes on

She could be a movie star
So sweet she could take my heart
Can't find the words to describe it (Describe it)
Lights flash everywhere she go
Lights out when I get her home
She tells me that I'm her favorite (Her favorite)

Ooh, baby, is it you, baby?
Nah, this party isn't really my vibe (My vibe)
It's cool baby, I got you, baby
And I know you're leaving with me tonight

She new to California, she know that I adore her
She got me like, "Ooh, I don't know what to do"
Sweet tea like Arizona, one look and I'm a goner
You're looking at me while they're looking at you

All eyes on you
Ah-ah-ah, ooh, oh-oh-ooh
All eyes on you
Ah-ah-ah, ooh, oh-oh-ooh (Yeah)

All eyes, all eyes, all eyes on
All eyes, all eyes, all eyes on
All eyes, all eyes, all eyes on you

She new to California (California)
She know that I adore her (She do)
She got me like, "Ooh, I don't know what to do"
Sweet tea like Arizona (Arizona)
One look and I'm a goner (Gone, gone)
You're looking at me while they're looking at you

All eyes on you (All eyes, all eyes, all eyes on)
Ah-ah-ah, ooh, oh-oh-ooh (All eyes, all eyes, all eyes on)
All eyes on you (All eyes, all eyes, all eyes on)
