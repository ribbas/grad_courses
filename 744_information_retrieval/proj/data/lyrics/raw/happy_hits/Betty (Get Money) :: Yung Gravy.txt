Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
(I'll never let you down, baby)
(It's really Yung Gravy)
Uh, aye

With your baby mama at the crib and blow her back out
Shawty Filipino and she call me Manny Pacquiao
Alley Oop without the hoop, they call me Jerry Stackhouse
Gazin' out in public, but your mama made me snap out
Before I get the dough, I got the morning routine
Wake up bright and early, this some brand new cream
Floss three times, baby, I'm so clean
Gravy got cheese, now that's poutine (Whoa, baby)

Gravy come in hot like I'm hoppin' off the griddle
Pull up on the kid if you're tryna get belittled
All the mamas love me, now I think I'm peanut brittle
Flex the rainbow, bangin' like some Skittles

Gravy, why you out of pocket? (Out of pocket)
Stop it (No, no)
I'm gettin' money, Gravy Crocker
Drop it

Never take a L no more
Never take a damn thing slow
All I know is chase this dough and get money (Get the money, get the money)
Never gonna take no loss
Never gonna lose my sauce
All I know is chase this (Whoa), and get money (Gettin' money, gettin' money, gettin' money)

Get money
Probably into the early morning
Or get money
Yeah, I live the fast life (Whoa)

Yeah, you know I life the fast live
I don't got a type, baby, I'm a cash type
Still gettin' dividends from a past life
I'll get your daddy's net worth on a bad night
'Cause I act right
Yeah, I'm rockin' Rick, clappin' ass-tleys like the '80s
Never give it up until the reaper come and slay me
Pull up with a Zelda and a Peach and a Daisy
I be dirty dancin', now they yellin', "Gravy Swayze"

Damn, Gravy, you so vicious (Ooh)
You so clean, so delicious (So delicious)
How come you ain't got no misses?
Count that paper, count the riches

Never take a L no more
Never take a damn thing slow
All I know is chase this dough and get money (Get the money, get the money)
Never gonna take no loss
Never gonna lose my sauce
All I know is chase this (Whoa), and get money (Gettin' money, gettin' money, gettin' money)

Get money
Get money, Gravy gettin' money
Or get money, whoa

Get money
Get money, Gravy gettin' money
Or get money, whoa
