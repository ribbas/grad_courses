Satellite
I see you swimming through this open sky
I rest my head upon these dandelions
The stars are envious of you tonight

Broken dreams
I'm writing poems of our memories
Wish I could hold you through computer screens
But all the static keeps us in between

La, da-da
We're walking on a line
A line that leads me straight, straight, straight to you

You're like a satellite
Crossing through my mind
It always leads me straight, straight, straight to you

Saw the news
Oh, what a sight, it left me so confused
They're telling stories that you're leaving soon
They'll never know what you've been going through

Shooting star
I watch you drift away into the dark
Sometimes I sit and wonder where you are
Sending me signals to my, sending me signals to my hollow heart

La, da-da
We're walking on a line
A line that leads me straight, straight, straight to you

You're like a satellite
Crossing through my mind
It always leads me straight, straight, straight to you

La, da-da
We're walking on a line
A line that leads me straight, straight, straight to you

You're like a satellite
Crossing through my mind
It always leads me straight, straight, straight to you

Satellite
Satellite
Satellite
Satellite

La, da-da
We're walking on a line
A line that leads me straight, straight, straight to you

You're like a satellite
Crossing through my mind
Straight, straight to you

La, da-da
We're walking on a line
A line that leads me straight, straight, straight to you (Straight)

You're like a satellite
Crossing through my mind
It always leads me straight, straight, straight to you

La, da-da
We're walking on a line (Walking on a line)
A line that leads me straight, straight, straight to you

You're like a satellite (Like a satellite)
Crossing through my mind
It always leads me straight, straight, straight to you (It leads me straight to you)
