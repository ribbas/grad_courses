(You don't feel so far away)
You don't feel so far away
You don't feel so far away
You don't feel so far away
You don't feel so far away
Yeah, yeah

Well, I was crusin' down the street right out by the beach
Two Birkenstocks on my feet (My feet)
Yeah, I was walkin' through the park till past after dark
Thinkin', "Where am I supposed to be?" (Supposed to be, yeah)
I may have gone too far, way past the boulevard
But I still see you in my dreams
I figure I can be wherever, long as I can feel the weather
And know that you never really feel so far away

You don't feel so far away
You don't feel so far away
You don't feel so far away
You don't feel so far away (Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait)

Well, it was half-past 2, swimmin' in the deep blue
Got the seashells at my feet (My feet)
Yeah, I was floatin' with the waves, soakin' up a summer day
Feelin' all the colors in the reef (Supposed to be, yeah)
I may have gone too far, way past the boulevard
But I still see you in my dreams
I figure I can be wherever, long as I can feel the weather
And know that you never really feel so far away

You don't feel so far away
You don't feel so far away
You don't feel so far away
You don't feel so far aw...

I'm feelin' closer, my baby
Feelin' close to you lately
Feelin' closer, my baby
Feelin' close to you lately

I'm feelin' closer, my baby (I'm feelin' closer)
Feelin' close to you lately (I'm feelin' closer)
Feelin' closer, my baby (I'm feelin' closer)
Feelin' close to you lately (I'm feelin')

I'm feelin' closer, my baby
Feelin' close to you lately (I'm feelin' close, I'm)
Feelin' closer, my baby (I'm feelin' close)
Feelin' close to you lately

I'm feelin' closer, my baby
Feelin' close to you lately
Feelin' closer, my baby
Feelin' close to you lately
