I'll be your destination
Tell me your favourite song
Make me your next location
Darlin' what you waiting for
I'll take you around the world to
Show you how I feel about you-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Vegas
Or we could fly to Rome
Let's hit Jamaica
Tequila down in Mexico
Or we could lay low
Spend a week under the covers
We can go St. Tropez
What you got to lose if I don't care about the rules
That's why I'm asking you to
Stay, stay

I'll be your destination
Tell me your favourite song
Make me your next location
Darlin' what you waiting for
I'll take you around the world to
Show you how I feel about you-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'll be your destination
Tell me your favourite song
Make me your next location
Darlin' what you waiting for
I'll take you around the world to
Show you how I feel about you-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Paris
Or we could go to Greece
Make love in Costa Rica, Ariba
Ah, my Mona Lisa
You're a masterpiece
Or we could lay low
Spend a week under the covers
We can go St. Tropez
What you got to lose if I don't care about the rules
That's why I'm asking you to
Stay, stay

I'll be your destination
Tell me your favourite song
Make me your next location
Darlin' what you waiting for
I'll take you around the world to
Show you how I feel about you-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'll be your destination
Tell me your favourite song
Make me your next location
Darlin' what you waiting for
I'll take you around the world to
Show you how I feel about you-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'll be your destination
I'll be your next vacation
Ooh and how I feel about you-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

I'll take you around the world to
Show you how I feel about you-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
