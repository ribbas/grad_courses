Oh, nothing
I was just saying nobody got it
Guess I'm in the wrong room

Boys are so out
They think the grass is greener than they realize, oh
Girl, it's alright
No, you don't really need him wasting your time, your time (That's right)

Try to upgrade you, he must be out his mind
He can play his games but that don't make him wise
'Cause a woman like you, he never could replace
Kill that boy with kindness, hey girl, you should say
You should say (You should say, you should say, you should say)
Oh, you should say (You should say, you should say)

Yeah, one-two-three

Good luck
Going 'round the world, chasing all the girls, thinking you'll find better, baby
Good luck
Looking for that touch, can't replace real love, thinking you'll find better, baby
Good luck

Boy you've been round the world
Loving on other girls
But you will never find a love like mine, a love like
Good luck
Boy you thought I was hurt
To see you with other girls
But I know you'll never find a love like mine, a love like mine
Good luck

Ah, ah, yeah

Hell no
You found out he was creeping on the down low (Down low)
So he gon' see the back of you when you walk
That's when you know he's gotten way too comfortable, comfortable
(That's right)

Tried to upgrade you, he must've bumped his head
He can play his games, but girl, did he forget
That a woman like you, he never could replace
Kill that boy with kindness, hey girl, you should say
You should say (You should say, you should say, you should say)
Oh, you should say (You should say, you should say)
Yeah, one-two-three

Good luck
Going 'round the world, chasing all the girls, thinking you'll find better, baby
Good luck
Looking for that touch, can't replace real love, thinking you'll find better, baby
Good luck

Boy you've been round the world
Loving on other girls
But you will never find a love like mine, a love like
Good luck
Boy you thought I was hurt
To see you with other girls
But I know you'll never find a love like mine, a love like mine
Good luck

Hey, no, no (You'll never)
Good luck (A love like mine, a love like)
Hey, no, no (You'll never)
Good luck (A love like mine, a love like)

He ain't worth the drama (Ah, ah)
In due time he'll get his karma (He'll get his karma)
You gon' found your happy ever after
But he won't find better
So wish him good luck
Girl, he won't find better
So wish him good luck

Yeah, one-two-three

Good luck
Going 'round the world, chasing all the girls, thinking you'll find better, baby (Better, baby)
Good luck
Looking for that touch, can't replace real love (Can't replace real love), thinking you'll find better, baby
Good luck

You'll never
Good luck
A love like mine, a love like mine
So good luck
See you with other girls (Good luck)
Thinking you'll find better, baby
Good luck
