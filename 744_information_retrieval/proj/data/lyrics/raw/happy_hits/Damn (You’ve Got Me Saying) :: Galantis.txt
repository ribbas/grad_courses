Let me explain it
When I did you wrong
I didn't know I'd feel this regret
But it drives me crazy
To see you move on
While I lay alone in my bed

If I could rewind
Take a step back in time
I would never do you like that
I made a mistake
So now it's too late
And there ain't no way you're takin' me back

You got me sayin' damn
I shouldn't have let you walk right out my life (Uh)
I should have treated you right
I should have been by your side
Like damn
I slipped and let you catch somebody's eye (Eye)
And now I can't even lie
It's killin' me inside
Like damn
I shouldn't have let you walk right out my life
I should have treated you right
I should have been by your side
Like damn
I slipped and let you catch somebody's eye (Eye)
And now I can't even lie
It's killin' me inside

Can't get no closure
But we said goodbye
I still feel the same as before (Before)
Keep my composure
Believe me, I've tried
To accept you're not mine anymore (No)

If I could rewind
Take a step back in time
I would never do you like that
Baby, I made a mistake
So now it's too late
And there ain't no way I'm gettin' you back

You got me sayin' damn
I shouldn't have let you walk right out my life (Uh)
I should have treated you right
I should have been by your side
Like damn
I slipped and let you catch somebody's eye (Eye)
And now I can't even lie
It's killin' me inside
Like damn
I shouldn't have let you walk right out my life
I should have treated you right
I should have been by your side
Like damn
I slipped and let you catch somebody's eye (Catch somebody's eye)
And now I can't even lie
It's killin' me inside (Ooh)

Damn
I should have never let you walk out my life
It's killin' me, it's killin' me inside
Damn
I should have never let you walk out my life
It's killin' me, it's killin' me inside
Damn
I should have never let you walk out my life
It's killin' me, killin' me inside
Damn
I should have never let you walk out my life
It's killin' me inside (Woah)

You got me sayin' damn
I shouldn't have let you walk right out my life (My life)
I should have treated you right (You right)
I should have been by your side
Like damn
I slipped and let you catch somebody's eye (Oh-oh)
And now I can't even lie
It's killin' me inside (Inside)
Like damn
I shouldn't have let you walk right out my life
I should have treated you right
I should have been by your side
Like damn
I slipped and let you catch somebody's eye
And now I can't even lie
It's killin' me inside
Like damn
