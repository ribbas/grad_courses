What would you do?
If I told you I loved you, baby, what would you do?
If I told you I need you, baby, would you come through?
If I told you to kiss me, baby, what would you do?
What would you do, what would you do, what would you do?

What would you do?
What would you do?
If I told you I loved you, baby, what would you do?
What would you do?
What would you do?
What would you do?
If I told you I loved you, baby, what would you do?

This may come as a surprise
But I keep how I feel inside, and tonight
There ain't nothing left to hide
Still got one question on my mind
My mind, ooh, my mind

Would you stay or would you run away?
I'm not saying forever
But you got me feeling some type of way
Are you down? 'Cause I really got to know

What would you do?
If I told you I loved you, baby, what would you do?
If I told you I need you, baby, would you come through?
If I told you to kiss me, baby, what would you do?
What would you do, what would you do, what would you do?

What would you do?
What would you do?
If I told you I loved you, baby, what would you do?

'Cause I'm losing my mind, said I'm losing my mind
Trying to keep it inside
Said I'm losing my mind, said I'm losing my mind

What would you do?
If I told you I loved you, baby, what would you do?
If I told you I need you, baby, would you come through?
If I told you to kiss me, baby, what would you do?
What would you do, what would you do, what would you do?

What would you do?
What would you do?
If I told you I loved you, baby, what would you do?
What would you do?
What would you do?
