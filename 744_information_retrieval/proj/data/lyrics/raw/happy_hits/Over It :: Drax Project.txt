You're making no sense
'Round and 'round in circles like it's hopeless
Sending and deleting your emotions when suits you best
Taking as you please
I'm just here wondering
Why would you wanna pick it up from our last goodbye?
Did you forget the words that you said last time?
I'm struggling with my pride 'cause you're on my mind
Pretty much all the time
Should I let this slide?

If you're over it, why'd you let me take you home?
If you're over it, then why'd you stay until the morning?
Crossing all the lines you made
It's clear to me that you're not really over it
You're not helping me get over

You-u-u-u, you-u-u-u-u-u, over
You-u-u-u, you-u-u-u-u-u, over

You-u-u-u, you-u-u-u-u-u, over
You-u-u-u, you-u-u-u-u-u, over

Do you want me or want me not?
Seems to me like you're just turning it on and off
Cut me loose instead of leaving me in the dark
It's getting old, make up your mind
Yes or no, black and white, yea 'cause

If you're over it, why'd you let me take you home?
If you're over it, then why'd you stay until the morning?
Crossing all the lines you made
It's clear to me that you're not really over it
You're not helping me get over you

You-u-u-u, you-u-u-u-u-u, over
You-u-u-u, you-u-u-u-u-u, over
You-u-u-u, you-u-u-u-u-u, over
You-u-u-u, you-u-u-u-u-u, over

Why do I pick it up when you hit my phone?
(Why'd you let me take you home?)
Always change your mind when you're left alone
(Why'd you stay until the morning?)
Said I wasn't the right one to get to know ya
We're not getting closer, told me it was over (yea)
You're not helping me get over

You-u-u-u, you-u-u-u-u-u, over
You-u-u-u, you-u-u-u-u-u, over
You-u-u-u, you-u-u-u-u-u, over
You-u-u-u, you-u-u-u-u-u, over
(Oooh) You-u-u-u-u-u, over
You-u-u-u, you-u-u-u-u-u, over
You-u-u-u, you-u-u-u-u-u, over
You-u-u-u, you-u-u-u-u-u, over
You're not helping me get over...
