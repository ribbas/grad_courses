Hold me closer
Hold me closer
Hold me closer
Hold me closer

Saw you dancing out the ocean
Running fast along the sand
A spirit born of earth and water
Fire flying from your hands

Oh

Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

Oh

Hold me closer
Hold me closer (Hold me closer)
Hold me closer
Hold me closer

There are caravans we follow
Drunken nights in dark hotels (Baby)
When chances breathe between the silence
When sex and love no longer gel

Oh

Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway (Baby)
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

Hold me closer
Hold me closer (Baby, baby)
Hold me closer
Hold me closer (Oh yeah)

Hold me closer
Hold me closer
(Hold me closer, me closer) Hold me closer
(Me closer, mm, yeah) Hold me closer
