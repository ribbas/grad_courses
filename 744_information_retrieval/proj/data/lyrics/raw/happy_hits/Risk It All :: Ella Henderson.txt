I heard that you're no longer together
Forget her, she never loved you like I did

I wasn't ready, but now I'm ready for you
The weight has been heavy, say that you miss me
I know you're unsteady and I don't mean to make this worse
But you need to hear these words

I think about the love you gave every day
I think about the hope you gave and took it away
And baby, if you give me a chance, I'll give all that I can
I know I would risk it all

I think about the love you gave every day
I think about the hope you gave and took it away
And baby, if you give me a chance, I'll give all that I can
I know I would risk it all

Love hurts
And it's a gamble saying three words
And I heard that you gotta lose to win sometimes (Win sometimes)

I wasn't ready, but now I'm ready for you
The weight has been heavy, say that you miss me
I know you're unsteady and I don't mean to make this worse
But you need to hear these words

I think about the love you gave every day
I think about the hope you gave and took it away
And baby, if you give me a chance, I'll give all that I can
I know I would risk it all (Risk it all)

I wasn't ready, I wasn't ready
Now I know I, now I know I, I'll risk it all
I wasn't ready, I wasn't ready
Now I know I, now I know I, I'll risk it all

(For you, I would, for you, I would
For you, I would) Yeah, I would risk it all
(For you, I would, for you, I would
For you, I would) Oh no, no

I think about the love you gave every day
I think about the hope you gave and took it away
And baby, if you give me a chance, I'll give all that I can
I know I would risk it all (Risk it all)

I wasn't ready, I wasn't ready
Now I know I, now I know I, I'll risk it all
I wasn't ready, I wasn't ready
Now I know I, now I know I, I'll risk it all
