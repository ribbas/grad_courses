[Joseph:]
I can't wait for you to come my way
I've been far away
But I'll keep running
Just to find a way to you till then

[Tarrek:]
I've been running from it
Tired of running from it
Scared of feeling something
Now I'm stuck and tryna get up out of this hole
I tried to be strong
I tried to make it work but I've been feeling too numb
Skies are bleeding on me
Why'd you leave me lonely?
Feeling Whitney, Stoney
Now I'm stuck and wonder where I ever went wrong
How could I be strong?
I'm fighting for your love

[Joseph:]
I can't wait for you to come my way
I've been far away
But I'll keep running
Just to find a way to you till then

[Issac:]
I don't see light in your love anymore
There ain't no reason in pouring a fall
I don't like feelings and feeling like running from something
And feeling so out of control
I know that the feelings are gone
I'm spending too much time alone
I'm hoping you pick up the phone
And ring me when you wanna stay overnight
My shoulder's right
My baby's all that I want
And I'll play them, all of my favourite songs
That lady is my favourite one

[Joseph:]
I can't wait for you to come my way
I've been far away
But I'll keep running
Just to find a way to you till then

Ain't never gonna let you go
Got my heart NASCAR racing
Shining, never fading
He just left you hanging
Feining for you love
All worth it for the waiting
Give you what you need
Take you where he won't
Can feel it when we're all alone
Know you're wanting something more
My heart is like an open door
Just ring me when you wanna go

I'll wait till you're home
Hold a place till you're coming home
Show you where the garden grows
Just ring me when you wanna go

I can't wait for you to come my way
I've been far away
But I'll keep running
Just to find a way to you till then
