Yeah

Sink until you're unimpaired
Slow motion like a rolling eye
We can hear you loud and clear
Suicide season is upon and high

Why you always saying, "Let the good times roll"?
Kick your mind open like a punk rock show
Uppercut bleeding to the soffit nose
If you didn't come home injured, would you say it was a good show?
'Cause every single fucking day, I try to roll my eyes and breathe
One hit, now I'm off this shit

Give up, give up
Give up, give up
Give up, give up
I can't hear you
Through the tension
Through the tension
Through the tension, right now
(This is only a distraction)

Swing, batter up, let's play
Power until the target bleeds
This gun will never turn on me
So, Paul Meany, will you drop that beat?

Why you always saying, "Let that shit go"?
Penny-wise fashion on the sad skid row
A gentrified neighborhood of blood soaked homes
Draw the lines a little further, now they're coming back to get you
'Cause every single fucking day I try to roll my eyes and breathe
One hit, now I'm off this shit

Give up, give up
Give up, give up
Give up, give up
I can't hear you
Through the tension
Through the tension
Through the tension, right now

Yo, I can't shine to save my life
But I'll feel through the dark without you
I set fires ablaze inside
And stepped in to the light to blind you

Give up, give up
Give up, give up
Give up, give up
I can't hear you
Through the tension
Through the tension
Through the tension, right now

I can't hear you
I can't hear you
I can't hear you
