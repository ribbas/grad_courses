Every girl from here to Soho,
Loves to tell me things I don't know.
Beautiful and smart, and not good for me,
At all.

All your boyfriends go to film school,
Nathan was in plays in high school, (how 'bout that?)
Me? I'm going to play the imbecile, who, 
Who keeps choosing you,
Even though you're bi-polar and you're selfish: I hate you! Ahhh!

Everyone is better than me, I think,
Everyone is better than, better than me,
Everyone is better than, better than me,
Hey, hey! Oh, hey!

[Piano Solo]

Look what you've done, now I'm a mess,
Today I even thought I'd wear a dress,
It's beautiful, so smart and no good for me,
At all...

Yeah!
Everyone is better than me, I think,
Throw your hands up if you agree with me,
Now everyone is better than me, I think,
Everyone is better than, better than me.
Better than, Ooooh hey, come on now!
Oh, oh! 
Whoah, whoah!
Whoah!

(So won't you go?)
