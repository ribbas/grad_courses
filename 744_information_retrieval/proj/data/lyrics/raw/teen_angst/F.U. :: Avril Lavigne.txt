I would tell you that I'm pissed
But I know you won't hear me
There's no point in talkin' shit
But I'll still say this clearly

You used to drive me crazy
But I don't feel nothing lately
And I think we're done here, maybe
Baby

Every time I talk to you
(You're not listening, you're not listening)
I waste my breath on you
(You're not listening, you're not listening)
I try to tell you about it
I yell, I scream and I shout it
Hate it, but it's true
I'm fucking over you

Pack your bass, call it quits
'Cause I don't want you near me (No, no)
You should read my fucking lips
'Cause you don't seem to hear me (Hear me)

You used to drive me crazy
But I don't feel nothing lately
And I think we're done here, maybe
Baby

Every time I talk to you
(You're not listening, you're not listening)
I waste my breath on you
(You're not listening, you're not listening)
I try to tell you about it
I yell, I scream and I shout it
Hate it, but it's true
I'm fucking over you

All this time I thought one day you would listen
All this time hoping you would change
All this time I spent wishing you would listen
All this time, all this time

Every time I talk to you
(You're not listening, you're not listening)
I waste my breath on you
(You're not listening, you're not listening)
I try to tell you about it
I yell, I scream and I shout it
Hate it, but it's true
I'm fucking over you
I'm fucking over you

So fuck you
Hahaha
