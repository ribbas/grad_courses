I heard a knock upon my door the other day
I opened it to find death staring in my face
The feel of mortal stalking still reverberates
Everywhere I go I drag this coffin just in case

My body's tremblin' sends shivers down my spine
Adrenaline kicks in, shifts into overdrive,
Your secrets keep you sick, your lies keep you alive
Snake eyes every single time, you roll with crooked dice

(Ah)

I felt the darkness as it tried to pull me down (pull me down)
The kind of dark that haunts a hundred year old house
I wrestle with my thoughts, I shook the hand of doubt
Running from my past, I'm praying feet don't fail me now

I've lost my goddamn mind
It happens all the time
I can't believe I'm actually
Meant to be here
Trying to consume
The drug in me is you
And I'm so high on misery
Can't you see?

I got these questions always running through my head
So many things that I would like to understand
If we are born to die and we all die to live
Then what's the point of living life if it just contradicts?

(Ah)

I felt the darkness as it tried to pull me down (pull me down)
The kind of dark that haunts a hundred year old house
I wrestle with my thoughts I shook the hand of doubt
Running from my past I'm praying feet don't fail me now

I've lost my goddamn mind
It happens all the time
I can't believe I'm actually
Meant to be here
Trying to consume
The drug in me is you
And I'm so high on misery
Can't you see?

I've lost
Myself
You tried to reach me but you just can't help me
So long
Goodbye
You tried to save me, it won't work this time

'Cause now

I've lost my fucking mind
And there's no fucking time
I can't believe I'm actually
Meant to be here
Trying to consume
The drug in me is you
And I'm so high on misery
Can't you see?
Oh, can't you see?
Can't you see?
