I tried to love you, but you're not my type
Tried to pretend, but it just don't feel right
To be your number one

Should have known better, I tried to stay cool
You were telling me I'm such a fool to say no
Number one

Make me behave like an animal
Make me behave like an animal

I'm asking nicely, give me what I want
I'll ask politely, give me what I want

I tried to love you, but you're not my type
Tried to pretend, but it just don't feel right
To be your number one

Make me behave like an animal
Make me behave like an animal

I'm asking nicely, give me what I want
I'll ask politely, give me what I want

Make me behave like an animal
Make me behave like an animal
Make me behave like an animal
Make me behave like an animal
