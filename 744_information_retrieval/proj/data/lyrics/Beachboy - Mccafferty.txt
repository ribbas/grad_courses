I swear to fucking god Chris
I'll turn this fucking car around
Shut the fuck up

I don't get parties or getting high
I just get low, most of the time
And I'll be there for you baby, but I've got to have some room
And you gotta keep your eyes on the new guys in the room
And the way they dance is crazy, I have never seen this shit
And the strobe lights, way too hot, so let's just get this over with
She says your lips tasted like they did way back in July
Headaches and overdose, I hope that we never die
October's always here, November never leaves
December disappears, she says to me

I dance really fast so you've gotta dance real fast
And my friends are all passed out in the back of my friend's van
She's got this sense of humor that goes over her forehead
Lindsey let me kiss your forehead

And I know that you think that I don't care about all the friends I left behind
The ones who stay up late at night screaming out their shattered minds
I know that you think that I don't care about the friends that I left behind
The ones who stay up late at night screaming out their shattered minds

And she's on top of me and it is hot, hot, hot
She says come on sweetheart take 'em off
So I will take 'em off, and then we take 'em off
And then her dad walks in. Oh shit her dad walks in

She says to dance really fast, 'cause I like to dance real fast
And my friends are all passed out in the back of my friend's van
And she's got this sense of humor that goes over her forehead
Lindsey let me kiss your forehead

And I know that you think that I don't care about all the friends I left behind
The ones who stay up late at night screaming out their shattered minds
I know that you think that I don't care about the friends that I left behind
The ones who stay up late at night screaming out their shattered minds

It's always a head game with you Nick
You never had a shot at any of this
So just smash your guitar. Smash your dreams
Grow up now is just what I mean
It's always a head case with you Nick
You never had a shot at any of this
So just smash your guitar. Smash your dreams
Grow up now is just what I mean
Oh

Grow up now is just what I mean
Grow up now is just what I mean
Grow up now is just what I mean
Grow up now is just what I mean

Oh fuck
Well we're here kids!
(No, Daddy, no!)
