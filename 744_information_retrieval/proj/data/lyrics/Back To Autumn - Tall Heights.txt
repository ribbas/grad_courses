We haven't been the same, you know
Since we buried you bellow
On that still winter day
In the plot you picked out so many years ago
When you laid your wife in her grave

Bring me back to autumn
Or lead me on to May
I am not ready to take the helm
Abandoned on your dying day

Played that reverie
And that's just fine with me
If the crows sit and caw
How cold and deep the freeze
Steals our every hope
Even after the thaw

But bring me back to autumn
Or lead me on to May
I am not ready to take the helm
Abandoned on your dying day

If I can here return
If I can ever learn
To fill the void, as they say
Grateful I have this earth
To channel you in my hands
Feel your force in a way

And it would bring me back to autumn
Or lead me on to May
I am not ready to take the helm
Abandoned on your dying day

And it would bring me back to autumn
Or lead me on to May
I am not ready to take the helm
Abandoned on your dying day
Your dying day
Your dying day
