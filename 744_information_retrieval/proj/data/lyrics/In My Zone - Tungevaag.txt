I just wanna let you know
I'm in my zone
I'm in my zone

I know what you want, what you need
Gotta take my hand and I'll take you higher
When you're feeling lost, incomplete
Gotta show you how to relight your fire

'Cause it's you and I, you better believe it
We ride or we'll die, so babe, can you feel me?
We're wiping the clocks and heading for much brighter days

I just wanna let you know
I'm in my zone
I'm in my zone
Nobody can stop me now
I'm in my zone
I'm in my zone

I just wanna let you know
I just wanna let you know

We can prove 'em wrong, let 'em know
Though we never want this feeling to end
We don't need to run anymore
Give 'em something that they'll never forget

'Cause it's you and I, you better believe it
We ride or we'll die, so babe, can you feel me?
We're wiping the clocks and heading for much brighter days

I just wanna let you know
I'm in my zone
I'm in my zone
Nobody can stop me now
I'm in my zone
I'm in my zone

I just wanna let you know
I'm in my zone
I'm in my zone
Nobody can stop me now
I'm in my zone
I'm in my zone

I just wanna let you know

I just wanna let you know
I'm in my zone
I'm in my zone
Nobody can stop me now
I'm in my zone
I'm in my zone

I just wanna let you know
