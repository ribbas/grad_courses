Y'all should've called me to work on the album earlier, man
We could've been making something great
Channel Tres, let's go

When the bass slide and that city lights up like, mm-hmm
Low high and that shit lights up like, "Ah"
When the bass slide and that city lights up like, mm-hmm
Low high and that shit lights up like, "Ah"
Put your hands up

I'm a MC, BYOB, bring your own bottles
VIP, MYOB, I brought my own models
Lay back smooth with the flow
So smooth when I step on the floor
Look back (Uh), Cadillac (I see you, boy)
Used to pull up in the red Volvo

Let's make moves outside this club
(Let's get out of here)
'Bout to make moves get back to the hub
(I gotta go back home)
Let's go

Trying to catch the bass, and I'll slide on you
Trying to catch a fade, 'bout to slide one on you
We up in the club, pour something in my cup
Got the whole city going up
Got the whole city going up
Out here acting up, no, we don't give a fuck
Got the whole city going up, hmm
Got the whole city going up

Let's make moves outside this club
(Let's get out of here)
'Bout to make moves get back to the hub
(I gotta go back home)

Got the whole city going up, hmm
Got the whole city going up
Got the whole city going up, hmm
Got the whole city going up
Got the whole city going up, hmm
Got the whole city going up
Got the whole city going up, hmm
Got the whole city going up
Let's go

(Let's go)
Got the whole city going up, hmm
Got the whole city going up
Got the whole city going up, hmm
Got the whole city going up
Got the whole city going up, hmm
Got the whole city going up
Got the whole city going up, hmm
Got the whole city going up

Got the whole city going up, hmm
Got the whole city going up
Got the whole city going up, hmm
Got the whole city going up
Got the whole city going up, hmm
Got the whole city going up
