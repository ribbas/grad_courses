(Money, money
Money, money
Money)

I gotta let my money fly
Where we gonna go tonight?
By the time the weekend comes
I'm dying just to feel alive
Pack it in the Cadillac
Let's just go and take a drive
'Cause I know a little place
Where the stakes are high and music's right

(Money, money)
Just a bit of that (Money)
This kind of taste, you never get it for free
It's about (Money, money)
Money's sweeter than honey
There ain't no limit when you're spend it with me

(Whoa)
Just a bit of that money, just a bit of that money
(Whoa)
Just a bit of that money
(Spend it with me)

Roll up to the parking lot
The valet knows my favourite spot
Feeling goddamn fresh
In my best Calvin Klein ascot
Yeah
You know this round's on me
You better order anything you want
I got the credit
Don't forget it takes a lot to be this nonchalant, hey

See your pair of eyes from across the bar
But he won't get what he's looking for
We don't think about tomorrow when we walk through that door
I'm in trouble man, that's for sure
Yeah, yeah

Into that (Money, money)
Just a bit of that (Money)
This kind of taste, you never get it for free
It's about (Money, money)
Money's sweeter than honey
There ain't no limit when you're spend it with me

(Whoa)
Just a bit of that money, just a bit of that money
(Whoa)
Just a bit of that money
Come spend it with me

(Money, money
Money, money
Money, money
Money, money)

This kind of taste, you never get it for free
It's about
