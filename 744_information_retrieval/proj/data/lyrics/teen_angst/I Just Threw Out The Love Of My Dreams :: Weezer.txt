I'm so tall, can't get over me
I'm so low, can't get underneath
I must be all these things
For I just threw out the love of my dreams

He's in my eyes, he is in my ears
He's in my blood, he is in my tears
I breathe love and see him every day
Even though my love is a world away

Oh, he's got me wondering
My righteousness is crumbling

Never before have I felt this way
I know what is right, but want for him to stay
I must be made of steel
For I just threw out the love of my dreams

He's in my eyes, he is in my ears
He's in my blood, he is in my tears
I breathe love and see him every day
Even though my love is a world away

Oh, he's got me wondering
My righteousness is crumbling

Oh, he's got me wondering
My righteousness is crumbling
And I see him every day
Even though my love's a world away

He's in my eyes, he is in my ears
He's in my blood, he is in my tears
I must be made of steel
For I just threw out the love of my dreams
