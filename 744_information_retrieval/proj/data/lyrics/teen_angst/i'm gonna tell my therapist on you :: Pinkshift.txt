Oh my God, why are you sad again?
Take a dose of something to forget
Walk a mile in my shoes
And if you don't come back
At least I've got nothing to lose

Hello, can I help you?
I don't think I've ever seen you before
And if you think that I should listen to you
I'm about to kick your ass through the door

Carry me further in regret
I tried to leave but regret's got quite a death grip
The meds aren't working for me anymore
I think I'm spiraling, I'm spiraling downwards
