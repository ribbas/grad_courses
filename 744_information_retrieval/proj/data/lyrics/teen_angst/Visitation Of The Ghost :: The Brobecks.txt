You think, you think you're pretty smart
But I can cause a little pain
She wraps the cord around her arm
Tries hard to find the little vein

Oh, she lines the pictures in a pretty row
To create the circumstances that the evidence will show
And who will be a witness for the solitary host?
If you sleep tonight, the visitation of the ghost

You think that I don't know your game
A pretty, pretty, pretty little face
Despite every book and every little kiss you took
She'll take your place

Oh, she lines the pictures, in a pretty row
To create the circumstances that the evidence will show
And who will be a witness for the solitary host?
If you sleep tonight, the visitation of the ghost

Oh my Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord... [Dallon]
Oh my Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord... [Background]
Oh my Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord... [Dallon]
Oh my Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord... [Background]
Oh my Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord... [Dallon]
Oh my Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord... [Background]
Oh my Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord... [Dallon]
Oh my Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord... [Background]
Oh my Lord... Oh Lord... [Dallon]

Yeah, She lines the pictures in a pretty row
To create the circumstances that the evidence will show
And who will be a witness for the solitary host?
If you sleep tonight, the visitation of the ghost
Of the ghost! Ghost!
Oh yeah!

She lines the picture in a pretty row
To create a circumstances that the evidence will show
And who will be a witness for the solitary host?
And if you sleep tonight, the visitation of the ghost
