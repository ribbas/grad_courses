Fuck

My head shakes when I sleep too long
And my mom cries when I sing this song
Why can't I be like you
You say things that don't make much sense
Like the drugs you did or the money you spent
Why can't I be so cool

My heart breaks at the drop of a dime
And I freak out when I lose my mind
Why can't I be like you
I need you and I need to fuck
But I talked to you and you don't say much
Why can't I keep my cool

Black out and I need to sit
And I wrote this but it don't mean shit
Why can't I be like you
I miss you and I let you down
And your voice is the perfect sound
Why can't I be so cool
