Okay, we need to fucking talk

Now I lay me down to sleep
Tell me do you think of me in your dreams (In your dreams)
When you're next to me (When you're next to me)
Always gotta cross the line
I'm just gonna take and waste your time (Your time)
You're so easy to read (You're so easy to read)

You will be there when I need it
You can call it what you want
But I will never be the one

You know I love to take control
So I'll be leaving you out here to bleed
Drag you down with me
You'll never get away from me
Feel me wrap around you until you scream
"How could you do this to me?"

Now I've cut off all the breaks
You best believe that I'm your worst mistake (Your worst mistake)
But you always make it
(But you always make it, but you always make it)
And you keep on crawling back
You're in too deep 'cause your heart's attached (Your heart's attached)
You know that this won't last (Yeah)

You know I like to take control (Take control)
So I'll be leaving you out here to bleed (Out here to bleed)
Drag you down with me (Drag you down with me, yeah)
You'll never get away from me (Away from me)
Feel me wrap around you until you scream (Until you scream)
"How could you do this to me?"

Who will be there when I need it?
You can call it what you want
But I will be your only one

You know I love to take control
So I'll be leaving you out here to bleed (Out here to bleed)
Drag you down with me
You'll never get away from me (Away from me)
Feel me wrap around you until you scream (Until you scream)
"How could you do this to me?"

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
How?
