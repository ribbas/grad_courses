You're ruining my life day by day
The butterflies you give me are literally making me nauseous
This is disgusting, like seriously dude?
What do you think you're doing?
You're like way older than me and you're gross
And I don't wanna do that

Never invite me over ever again
Just kidding, please do!
I really wanna hang out with you
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

But fuck you! You're so old, dude!
Like seriously, what do you think you're doing?
Your hands are so big and you're so tall, wow
You know, I kinda wish I had let you do that one thing that one time
But in retrospect it would've been a bad idea, because
You don't care about me, and like, I care about you, so that's bad

Never invite me over ever again
Just kidding, please do!
I really wanna hang out with you
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

I'm really ironically pissed off right now
I'm feeling quite lost right now
Like in a really big forest in Lake Tahoe or something
Somewhere big and scary 'cause you're scary as shit, dude!
Like, I don't really know what I can tell you
You kinda freak me out but we could be friends!

Never invite me over ever again
Just kidding, please do!
I really wanna hang out with you
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Never invite me over ever again
Just kidding, please do!
I really wanna make out with you
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Never invite me over ever again
Just kidding, please do!
I really wanna hang out with you
