Everybody thinks they know things
But nobody can say they know me

These drugs are fucking with my head
I think my mailman is a fed
I know my mother wants me dead
'Cause she hates the smell of cigarettes

These drugs are fucking with my head
I think my mailman is a fed
I know my mother wants me dead
'Cause she hates the smell of cigarettes

I can't trust you
I know you bleed blue
I shouldn't tell you
But nobody likes you

Everybody thinks they know things
But nobody can say they know me

These drugs are fucking with my head
I think my mailman is a fed
I know my mother wants me dead
'Cause she hates the smell of cigarettes

These drugs are fucking with my head
I think my mailman is a fed
I know my mother wants me dead
'Cause she hates the smell of cigarettes

She hates the smell of cigarettes
I'm pretty sure she wants me dead
I'm pretty sure she wants me dead
