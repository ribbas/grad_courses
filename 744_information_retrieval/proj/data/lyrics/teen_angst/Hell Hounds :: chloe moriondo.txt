Hm, hm-mm

Told you not to look my way
To try and act your age
Eyes down on the pavement
Now, you're gonna have to pay
This happens every day
You don't wanna see my basement

You're tall, but
In my boots, I'm taller
And I think you'd look better in a collar
You're tall, but
In my boots, I'm taller
And I think you'd look better in a collar

Hell hounds
Yeah, they'll put you in the dog pound
No, you shouldn't mess around
'Cause they're gonna (Arf, arf, arf, arf)
Hell hounds
Baby, yeah, they'll put you underground
Yeah, they'll get you hell-bound
Make you wanna
(Arf, arf)

That's right, I'll tie you on a leash
And make you bite on a bone
All night, you'll crawl at my feet
Or I'll make you wear a fucking cone, 'cause
I-I, I-I, I-I, I
Can't say goodbye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye, bye, yeah

You're tall, but
In my boots, I'm taller
And I think you'd look better in a collar
You're tall, but
In my boots, I'm taller
And I think you'd look better in a collar

Hell hounds
Yeah, they'll put you in the dog pound
No, you shouldn't mess around
'Cause they're gonna (Arf, arf, arf, arf)
Hell hounds
Baby, yeah, they'll put you underground
Yeah, they'll get you hell-bound
Make you wanna
(Arf, arf, arf, arf)

I-In a collar
Oh, wait, shit
Sorry, I forgot it
Ah-ah
Nevermind, do it again
