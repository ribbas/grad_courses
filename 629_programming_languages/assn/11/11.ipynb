    "Both Thread 1 and Thread 2 depend on acquiring 2 locks that are nested within each other at alternating orders. For the threads to continue, they have to acquire the first lock, increment the count, acquire the second lock then release both of the locks. The program hangs when the outer lock of both of the threads are available and acquired at the same time, i.e. when `Thread-1` acquires `count_lock` and `Thread-2` acquires `status_lock` simultaneously, both of the threads starves while waiting for their inner locks to be freed by the other thread which does not happen.
