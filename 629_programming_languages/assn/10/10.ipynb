    "One major disadvantage of inheritance is the introduction of tight coupling between the base and derived classes. Once a derived class is declared, expanding its capabilities becomes very limited due to the strong dependence on its base class. Maintainance of both of the classes becomes tedious as well, often requiring both the base and derived classes to receive concurrent and interdependent updates."
