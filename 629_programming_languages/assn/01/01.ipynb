    "A major contributor of the imperative programming model was John W. Backus. John developed FORTRAN for IBM in the 1950s to provide a more convenient and human-friendly interface to the machine languages of the original computers. FORTRAN allowed for the creation of more complex programs with the introduction of named variables, complex expressions, subprograms, and many other features that still exist on modern languages.\n",

    "John McCarthy developed Lisp, which is often considered the first programming language to implement the functional model. John developed the language for IBM in the 1950s as a practical mathematical notation for computer programs. Lisp is based on lambda calculus and found its uses in the early fields of artificial intelligence after its publication.\n",

On the other hand, the lack of explicit type declarations of variables introduces a lack of clarity. Variables are prone to be unintentionally casted to different types or invalid operations may be performed on them. These errors may only be visible during runtime, or cause undefined behavior."
