\subsection{Abstract Factory Pattern}
The abstract factory pattern is present in the \texttt{SST::Factory} class. In the repository, the class can be located at \texttt{factory.h}. The class is used to create several concrete products, including \texttt{Component} and \texttt{Module} objects.

Figure \ref{fig:af} lists the methods of the class following the typical steps dictated by the pattern.

Each of the methods accept parameters to instantiate the corresponding ConcreteProducts. There are several Client classes that call these methods, including \texttt{Simulation}, \texttt{BaseComponent} and the \texttt{main} function itself.
