% Section 3:  Be sure that you understand from the rubric in the Syllabus how the number and type of patterns selected affects your grade.

% Section 3.1:  Make sure to explain why you have both AF and FM patterns here.  Is one implementing the other?
% Explain whether or not the variadic form is consistent with the pattern.  Just from the function signature that you've shown I'm not sure that it is.
% In general be sure to explain all of the roles of the pattern and how they are filled by the implementation or not.  Roles include not just the classes, but the relationships and methods, too.
% Explain how the implementation deals with issues that were part of our discussion, for example, how is the client configured with a particular ConcreteCreator?

% Section 3.2:  Is the Singleton implemented correctly?  Does it have any special features that help it deal with being instantiated in a multi-threaded environment, like locks, DCL or being instantiated at a particular place in the program?  Is it ever destroyed?

% Section 3.3:  Does the Strategy have a Context?  How is the ConcreteStrategy chosen?

% These aren't the only questions to ask about the patterns.
