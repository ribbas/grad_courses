This promotes loose coupling between the ConcreteCommand and its Receivers from the Client. I think each AbstractCommands can have a single Invoker to handle Commands of the same type.\n",

    "1. Both of the creational patterns return new instances of specific classes, which is why the Prototype pattern can be considered a special form of Factory Method. However, copying all of the attributes of an object might require the `clone` method in Prototype to be more complex than a simple call of `new` in Factory Method. I think this pattern should be used in systems that frequently perform deep-copy of objects and needs to decouple the class from the Client. This motivation is similar to Factory Methods, except Prototypes deal with the single class it is related to without the need for separate classes. For this exercise, copying Node objects along with all its children becomes much more convenient and elegant by dedicating the copying of the subtree to a single method.\n",

However, if the ConcreteCommands we were implementing also took the roles of ConcretePrototypes, then we could clone copies of them in the Invoker instead of creating new instances. These copies can be stored in the history stack."
