    "A real-world example of a Chain of Responsibility can be found within the flow of requests in a corporate hierarchy. If the expense report is fully compliant with the firm's policies and contains pre-approved transactions, the report system automatically approves the employee. However, if the report contains transactions with custom formats or the total amount is outside the preapproved expense limit, then the system passes it onto the immediate supervisor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The immediate supervisor now has the ability to evaluate the expense report. If the custom transactions are compliant with the firm's policies and the amount of the expenses is within a certain limit, the manager can approve the report. However, if they are unsure about some transactions in the report not being aligned with the firm's policies, they will pass it up to their managers to validate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same logic can be applied to a variable number of managers until the report gets sent to the financial department, which consists of experts in the firm's policies on expense reports. Once the department gets a chance to review the report, they will determine if it is valid and expense the employee on their request. However, if they find any flaws in the report, or if they require more information, the report gets rejected and sent back to the employee.\n",

    "- ConcreteHandlers -> SystemApprover, ManagerApprover and FinanceDeptApprover  \n",

    "A software example of the Chain of Responsibility can be demonstrated using a simple calculator that evaluates 2 operands and an operation. The calculator only supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. If an expression contains an operator that is not supported, the calculator returns an error message. \n",
    "\n",
    "The operations in the calculator have uneven frequencies of their usage. For example, addition is used a lot more frequently than subtraction, which has a higher frequency than multiplication, and so on. In an effort to improve performance, the calculator attempts to perform operations in the following order: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n",
