    "2. The SAX API for representing XML delays parsing of parts of the XML file until the application actually requires them. Achieve part of that behavior by implementing a virtual Proxy for Element that allows deferring parsing of the Elementâ€™s children until they are needed.\n",

    "  - The Proxy will need to keep some kind of reference into the file for where it needs to resume parsing when the real Element is required.\n",

    "    1. Does either the Abstract Factory or Builder retain state, information about past operations?\n",
    "    2. What is the duration of that state?  The lifetime of the construction process, of the document that is created or of the application?\n",
    "    3. Which pattern, Singleton or Monostate, provides a simpler interface for use by its client?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Proxy\n",
    "    1. What parts of the Element should be created immediately with the Proxy vs. being created with the real Element?\n",
    "    2. How does the application create a ProxyElement instead of an Element?\n",
    "    3. What information needs to be stored in the Element in order to \"pause\" the parsing process?\n",
    "    4. What objects or patterns must the Proxy coordinate with in order to participate in the parsing process?"
