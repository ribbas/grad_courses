# Assignment 5

The assignment asked for the implementation of the following patterns to the program:

- singleton
- proxy

## Source Files

A combination of the original implementation, my implementation of Assignment 3 and the solution to the last assignment implementation were used. `Test.cpp` has been modified to add command line options for the Iterator and Builder patterns.

To compile the assignment, the updated CMakeLists.txt file can be used.

## Modifications for Assignment

### Singleton

### Proxy
