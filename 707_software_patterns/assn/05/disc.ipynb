    "Once it has been determined that usage of the singleInstance is no longer needed, a Singleton can be destroyed. However, this begs the question on the visibility of the Singleton. Since it manages the creation and maintainence of the singleInstance, it is expected that the Singleton manages the deletion of it as well. Naturally, the destructor should be private to the class away from the client as well, but it becomes difficult to trace all the clients' references to it and increases the possibility of dangling references. Implicit destruction sounds like a safe approach."
