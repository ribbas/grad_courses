    "1. I think it is possible for a Mediator to become spaghetti code with long methods of conditionals. When researching this, I came across the term \"God object\" which is defined as an anti-pattern object that \"knows or does too much\". I think that is certainly a possible issue from adding more logic as the hierarchy of objects increases. However, the purpose of the pattern in the first place is to prevent potential spaghetti code in the communication code between objects. Applying the strategy pattern to the mediator class can be a relatively convenient solution to avoid bloating the class."

    "1. One clear indication of a system using the pattern extensively is if there are many instances of the program writing to stdout, a file, or some other logging methods. A brute force way to debug such code would be to find all these instances to debug individually. These `update()` methods can also be useful to debug other issues in the program, where they can be used to log execution breakpoints, variable values, etc."
