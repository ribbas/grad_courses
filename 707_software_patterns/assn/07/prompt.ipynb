    "1. Create an Adapter or Bridge to use the real org.w3c.dom structure as a wrapper around the Node and Document members of the edu.jhu.apl.patterns_class.dom DOM structure. For users of the C++ implementation, use the  supplied subset of the xerces-c++ DOM implementation . In both languages, donâ€™t worry about trying to create methods for parts of the org.w3c.dom which do not have implementations in the patterns_class.dom.  While I am only looking for complete implementations of Node and Document, there will still be some need to touch the other DOM classes in order to fully realize those two.\n",
