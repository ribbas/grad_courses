# Assignment 4

The assignment asked for the implementation of the following patterns to the program:

- template method
- abstract factory
- builder

## Source Files

A combination of the original implementation, my implementation of Assignment 3 and the solution to the last assignment implementation were used. The Strategy pattern in XMLSerializer was maintained from the last assignment's solution, adding `Whitespace.hpp` to the source.

To compile the assignment, the updated CMakeLists.txt file can be used.
