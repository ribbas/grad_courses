# Null Object

1. Is Null Object suitable or preferable as a list terminator? Why or why not?
   e.g., instead of the "NULL" in:

```
for (Obj o = list.start(); o != NULL; o=o.next()) {}
```

2. The pattern description states circumstances in which Null Object should be applied. What behaviors would not benefit from representation as a Null Object?

3. At what level in a type hierarchy is it appropriate to implement the null object behavior? I.e., does every interface related by inheritance need one?
